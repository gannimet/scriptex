               ACT ONE

               FADE IN:

               EXT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - DAY

               Morning breaks over the stately hotel.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GREAT NORTHERN DINING ROOM - DAY

               DALE COOPER, at the corner table, takes a sip of coffee and 
               orders breakfast from waitress TRUDY.

                                     COOPER
                         Shortstack of griddlecakes, maple 
                         syrup, lightly heated and a slice of 
                         ham. Nothing beats the taste of maple 
                         syrup when it collides with ham.

                                     TRUDY
                         Griddlecakes, side a' ham. Warmup?

               Cooper nods appreciatively. Trudy refills his cup, exits. 
               Cooper takes a sip, nearly hums with approval. Then looks up 
               to find AUDREY HORNE standing before him. Audrey smiles, 
               beautiful, rubs a little sleep out of her eyes.

                                     AUDREY
                         Good morning, Colonel Cooper.

                                     COOPER
                         Just Agent, Audrey. Special Agent.

                                     AUDREY
                              (caressing the words)
                         Special Agent.

                                     COOPER
                         Please. Sit down.

                                     AUDREY
                              (unsure)
                         I'm in a hurry.

                                     COOPER
                         For what?

               She doesn't know what to say or do. So she offers a nervous 
               shrug instead.

                                     COOPER
                         Audrey, that perfume you're wearing 
                         is incredible.

                                     AUDREY
                         Do you really think so?

               Cooper takes a pen from his pocket, hands it to her with a 
               napkin.

                                     COOPER
                         Write your name down for me.

                                     AUDREY
                              (eager)
                         Okay.

               She takes the pen and writes carefully, hands it back to 
               Cooper. He looks at it.

                                     COOPER
                         Audrey, there's something you'd like 
                         to tell me.

                                     AUDREY
                              (blushing)
                         There is?

               Beat. All she wants is to be close to him. Cooper produces a 
               note from his pocket.

                                     COOPER
                         You slipped this under my door night 
                         before last.

                                     AUDREY
                         I did?

               Cooper nods. Audrey comes clean.

                                     AUDREY
                         I wanted to help you. For Laura.

                                     COOPER
                         Were you and Laura friends?

                                     AUDREY
                              (simply)
                         No.
                              (beat)
                         But I understand her. Better than 
                         the rest.

                                     COOPER
                         What is "One-Eyed Jack's?"

                                     AUDREY
                         It's a place up north. Men go there.

                                     COOPER
                         What about women?

                                     AUDREY
                              (blushing again)
                         Women work there.

                                     COOPER
                         Did Laura work there?

                                     AUDREY
                         I don't know. Laura worked at my 
                         father's department store.

                                     COOPER
                         "Horne's?"

                                     AUDREY
                         He named it after himself.

                                     COOPER
                              (on to something)
                         Where at Horne's department store?

                                     AUDREY
                              (she thinks)
                         At the perfume counter.

                                     COOPER
                              (making the connection)
                         So did Ronette Pulaski.

                                     AUDREY
                              (it must mean something)
                         Really?

               Cooper looks up, sees SHERIFF TRUMAN and LUCY MORAN coming 
               towards him from the far end of the dining room. Cooper looks 
               at Audrey's writing.

                                     COOPER
                         The right-ward slant in your 
                         handwriting indicates a romantic 
                         nature, Audrey. A heart that yearns. 
                         Be careful.

                                     AUDREY
                              (a whisper)
                         I do?

                                     COOPER
                         I'm going to have to ask you to leave 
                         now.

                                     AUDREY
                              (sees the Sheriff, 
                              flustered)
                         Police business.

               Cooper nods, winks. Audrey blushes, rises.

                                     AUDREY
                         Thank you for talking to me.

               She leaves as Truman and Lucy reach the table, eager to hear 
               Cooper's news: the identity of Laura's killer. The Waitress 
               arrives with Cooper's breakfast.

                                     COOPER
                         Two more coffees please.
                              (re: Audrey as she 
                              exits)
                         Pretty girl.
                              (back to Truman and 
                              Lucy)
                         Hungry? The griddlecakes are 
                         outstanding.

                                     TRUMAN
                              (sits; hushed, urgent)
                         Who killed Laura Palmer?

               Truman and Lucy lean in, the suspense is killing them. Trudy 
               pours coffee for them, as Cooper takes a bite of griddlecake, 
               then, finally:

                                     COOPER
                         Let me tell you about the dream I 
                         had last night.

               Truman nods at Lucy. She whips our a steno, pad and pencil.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Tibet?

                                     COOPER
                         No. You were there, Harry. And so 
                         were you, Lucy. Do you have a sketch 
                         artist?

                                     TRUMAN
                         Andy sketches from time to time.

                                     COOPER
                         Interesting. I dreamed it was Deputy 
                         Hawk. Find out if Sarah Palmer has 
                         had any disturbing dreams. If she 
                         has, there may be important clues in 
                         her dreams as well.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Clues.

                                     COOPER
                         My dream is a code waiting to be 
                         broken. Break the code, solve the 
                         crime.

                                     LUCY
                              (writing, whispering)
                         Break the code, solve the crime.

                                     COOPER
                         In my dream, Sarah Palmer saw her 
                         daughter's killer crouched at the 
                         foot of her bed. Hawk sketched a 
                         picture of the killer. I got a phone 
                         call from a one-armed man named Mike. 
                         The killer's name was Bob.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Bob and Mike?

                                     COOPER
                         Different Bob. Different Mike. They 
                         lived above a convenience store. 
                         Mike couldn't stand the killing any 
                         longer so he cut off his own arm. 
                         Bob vowed he would kill again. So 
                         Mike shot him.
                              (takes another bite)
                         Do you know where dreams come from, 
                         Harry?

                                     TRUMAN
                         Not specifically.

                                     COOPER
                              (very happy)
                         Acetylcholine neurons fire high, 
                         voltage impulses into the forebrain. 
                         The impulses become pictures, the 
                         pictures become your dream. But no 
                         one knows why we choose these 
                         particular pictures.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Was that the end of your dream?

                                     COOPER
                              (back to business)
                         Suddenly it was twenty-five years 
                         later. I was old, sitting in a red 
                         room. There was a midget in a red 
                         suit and a beautiful young woman who 
                         looked exactly like Laura Palmer. 
                         The little man told me my favorite 
                         gum was coming back in style and 
                         didn't his cousin look exactly like 
                         Laura Palmer?

                                     TRUMAN
                         Which cousin?

                                     COOPER
                         The beautiful girl. Sometimes her 
                         arms bend back. She's filled with 
                         secrets. Where they're from birds 
                         sing a pretty song and there's always 
                         music in the air. Then the midget 
                         did a dance. Laura kissed me on the 
                         mouth. And whispered the killer's 
                         name in my ear.

                         I don't remember.

                         Damn.

                         Harry, our job is simple: break the 
                         code, solve the crime.

               Cooper finishes his pancakes.

                         What does the midget stand for?

                                     COOPER
                         Just about everything, Lucy.

               Just then: Sheriff Truman's walky-talky shrieks. He answers 
               it.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Yeah... Uh-huh... Right away.
                              (turns it off)
                         That was Andy. There's a fight at 
                         the morgue.

               NORMA JENNINGS and PAROLE OFFICER WILSON MOONEY occupy a 
               booth in the back. Mooney sips coffee, notes Norma's good 
               looks with a roving eye. In mid-conversation:

                         ...in short, your husband has been a 
                         model prisoner, an inspiration to 
                         guard and inmate alike. He greets 
                         the day with a smile and confounds 
                         adversity with a kind word. He's a 
                         credit to his serial number.

               Mooney says it with a little come-hither grin. Norma just 
               stares, takes a drag off her cigarette, ignores him. Mooney 
               is forced to continue:

                         Hank's parole hearing is scheduled 
                         for Wednesday. Barring unforeseen 
                         circumstance, with your full support 
                         before the board, he should be 
                         released shortly thereafter. Any 
                         questions?

                                     NORMA
                         No.

                              (biting her tongue)
                         No.

                                     MOONEY
                         I'm sure Hank appreciates your 
                         unwavering devotion.
                              (to file)
                         Now, I'll need to check some

                         married for...

                         I can't have any.

                                     MOONEY
                         How would you characterize your 
                         current relationship?

                                     NORMA
                         What do you mean, Mr. Mooney?

                                     MOONEY
                         Are you planning a divorce, Mrs. 
                         Jennings?

                                     NORMA
                         Not a divorce, no.

               Mooney hears the qualification.

                                     MOONEY
                         Will you help Hank find the job he 
                         needs to effect a successful parole?

                                     NORMA
                         Yes.

                                     MOONEY
                         How, exactly

                                     NORMA
                         I own the Double "R", Mr. Mooney.

               A beat. Norma can't stand him and Mooney knows it. Still, he 
               presses on:

                                     MOONEY
                         You're quite a girl, Norma. You must 
                         get all kinds of Romeos in here 
                         begging for favors. How do you keep 
                         them from your door?

               It's his last attempt. Norma knocks it out of the ballpark:

                                     NORMA
                         I usually tell them my homicidally 
                         jealous husband is doing three-to-
                         five for manslaughter but expects to 
                         become a productive member of society 
                         real soon.

                                     MOONEY
                              (all business)
                         Well. That should conclude our session 
                         for today.

                                     NORMA
                         Thank you.

                                     MOONEY
                         No, no. Thank you, Mrs. Jennings--

               Too late. Norma's already out of the booth, stepping back to 
               the counter. Mooney picks up his file, watches her leave 
               him.

               ANGLE ON COUNTER

               A pale and wan SHELLY JOHNSON, newly arrived, sets her purse 
               beneath the cash register.

                                     NORMA
                         I didn't expect you till after the 
                         funeral.

                                     SHELLY
                         I figured you could use some help.

               Norma pauses, looks beneath the register. She can SEE Shelly's 
               purse, slightly open. And she can see a brand new handgun 
               inside it.

                                     NORMA
                              (lowers her voice)
                         Shelly, what're you doing with a gun 
                         in your purse?

                                     SHELLY
                         Nothin'.

                                     NORMA
                         "Nothin'." Nobody does "nothin'" 
                         with a gun.

                                     SHELLY
                         I bought it. It's for protection. 
                         Peace of mind, anyway. You know, 
                         what happened to Laura.

                                     NORMA
                         You'd be better off hiring a lawyer.

                                     SHELLY
                         I can't afford one.

                                     NORMA
                         Well watch yourself. Understand?

               Shelly nods, pouts. Norma cases up a little.

                                     NORMA
                         Careful you don't murder your makeup.

               Norma grins, slips off toward hungry customers.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. TWIN PEAKS MORGUE - DAY

               SUDDENLY we are inside the Twin Peaks morgue in the midst of 
               a reeling argument. DOC HAYWARD squares off opposite ALBERT 
               ROSENFIELD, the impossibly rude pathologist. DEPUTY ANDY 
               BRENNAN stands to the side, mute, ineffectual. And BEN HORNE 
               physically separates the two men.

               A white partition separates the men from the body of Laura 
               Palmer.

                                     HAYWARD
                         I have never in my life met a man 
                         with so little regard for human 
                         frailty. Have you no compassion?!

                                     ALBERT
                         I've got compassion running out of 
                         my nose, pal. I'm the Sultan of 
                         Sentiment!

               Horne pushes them apart. Hayward and Albert pause, red with 
               fury. Finally:

                                     ALBERT
                         "Doctor" Hayward--and I use the term 
                         so loosely my gums are flapping--I 
                         have traveled thousands of miles, 
                         and apparently several centuries to 
                         this forgotten sinkhole in order to 
                         perform a series of tests. I do not 
                         ask you to understand them. I am not 
                         a cruel man. I only ask you to get 
                         the hell out of my way so I can finish 
                         my work!!

                                     HAYWARD
                         We are here to escort Laura Palmer's 
                         body to the cemetery. If you think, 
                         for one minute, that we will leave 
                         here without her, you are out of--

                                     HORNE
                         All right all right all right. Dr. 
                         Rosenfield. Please. You are not 
                         dealing with the unsophisticated 
                         here.

               Albert rolls his eyes so hard they, nearly spin out of the 
               sockets.

                                     HORNE
                              (the high road)
                         Leland Palmer could not be with us 
                         today. I have agreed to appear on 
                         his behalf. And I know I speak for 
                         all of us, the Palmer family included, 
                         when I say that we understand and 
                         appreciate the value of your work. 
                         But, as their representative, I must 
                         insist we consider the feelings of 
                         the Palmer family as well.

               Deputy Andy clears his throat, figures he might assist:

                                     ANDY
                         Dr. Rosenferd, we just got to get 
                         Laura's body to the funeral on time.

               Albert glares.

                                     ALBERT
                         Did you speak?!

               Andy wishes he was invisible. Albert turns calmly back to 
               Horne.

                                     ALBERT
                         Mr. Horne. I realize that your 
                         position in this fair community pretty 
                         well guarantees venality, insincerity 
                         and a rather irritating method of 
                         expressing yourself. Stupidity, 
                         however, is not a necessarily inherent 
                         trait, so please listen carefully. 
                         You can have a funeral any old time. 
                         Dig hole, plant coffin. I, however, 
                         cannot perform these tests next year, 
                         next month, next week, or tomorrow! 
                         I must perform them now. So please, 
                         why don't you and the rest of the 
                         Bumpkin Brigade return to porch 
                         rockers and resume whittling. I've 
                         got a lot of cutting and pasting to 
                         do--

                                     HAYWARD
                         That does it. I'm taking charge of 
                         the body, you won't touch Laura again 
                         from this moment on--

               Hayward steps toward the partition, Albert grabs him by the 
               arm.

                                     ALBERT
                         Nor so fast, Old-Timer--

               They square off, ready to fight again. Horne tries pull them 
               apart. And, just in time, Agent Cooper and Sheriff Truman 
               step into the morgue, the fray.

                                     COOPER
                         Gentlemen.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Harry, thank God--

                                     ALBERT
                         Cooper, this mindless old fool is 
                         obstructing a criminal investigation. 
                         Cuff him.

                                     HAYWARD
                         He won't release Laura's body for 
                         the funeral, he's not human.

                                     ALBERT
                         Certainly has a way with an insult 
                         though.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Hey that's enough.

                                     ALBERT
                         Zip it, Squarejaw.
                              (to Cooper)
                         I do not suffer fools gladly. Fools 
                         with badges, never. I want no contact 
                         with this hulking boob--

                                     TRUMAN
                         I've had about enough of your insults.

               Albert steps forward, grabs him by the lapels.

                                     ALBERT
                         Oh yeah? Well I've had about enough 
                         of morons and half-wits, cretins and 
                         congenital idiots, dolts, dunces, 
                         dullards, and dumbbells. And you, 
                         Chowderhead, lummox with badge and 
                         billy club, you, Sheriff Yokel you 
                         blithering hayseed, you have had 
                         enough of me!??

                                     TRUMAN
                              (calm as ice)
                         Yes I have.

               Truman levels Albert with a single punch to the jaw. Albert 
               tumbles backward onto his butt. A beat. Albert looks up at 
               Truman, shocked beyond measure. Cooper intervenes in a flash. 
               He turns to Truman, orders:

                                     COOPER
                         Harry, wait in the car.

               Truman starts to speak, sees the steel in Cooper's eyes. He 
               exits without a word.

                                     ALBERT
                         Oh well. That's nice. How appropriate.
                              (gets to his feet, 
                              yells after Truman)
                         The rustic sucker punch. Why not 
                         gunplay? A hail of bullets would be 
                         nice--

                                     COOPER
                         That's enough. The Sheriff didn't 
                         mean anything.

                                     ALBERT
                         He hit me.

                                     COOPER
                         Well. I'm sure he meant to do that.

               Albert starts to rail, but Cooper shuts him up with a gesture.

                                     COOPER
                         Albert, I want the girl's body 
                         released to her family now. I want 
                         to see your test results by noon. 
                         Those are orders.

               Albert weighs his options, nods assent, marches off. A tense 
               beat. Ben Horne clears his throat. Doc Hayward turns to 
               Cooper.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Thank you, Agent Cooper.

               Cooper nods. Hayward, Horne, and Andy follow Albert out of 
               the room. A beat. Cooper remains, looks at the white 
               partition. He steps toward it.

               ANGLE ON PARTITION

               Agent Cooper pauses for a moment. stares quietly at Laura 
               Palmer's body. HOLD ON Cooper. The sadness in his eyes.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                       END ACT ONE

                                         ACT TWO

               FADE IN:

               EXT. LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - DAY

               Truman and Cooper pull up to the Johnson house, park the 
               cruiser next to Leo's truck rig. They step out of the cruiser. 
               Truman stops, deeply troubled about the morgue altercation.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I can't believe I decked him. It was 
                         out of line, it was unprofessional, 
                         it was probably illegal.

                                     COOPER
                         Harry, there are many ways to handle 
                         an insult. But sometimes there's 
                         just no substitute for a stiff right 
                         hook.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Tell me I'm not going to get my butt 
                         kicked by the Bureau.

                                     COOPER
                         Albert's been hit before. He will be 
                         hit again. You'll get your buttkicked 
                         over my dead body.
                              (takes a deep breath, 
                              enjoys)
                         Look at that, there's a duck on the 
                         lake. Fill me in on Leo Johnson.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Leo's one of those guys you keep on 
                         your list and you keep an eye on, 
                         but we've never caught him with his 
                         hand in the cookie jar.

               They turn a corner and come upon LEO JOHNSON, behind the 
               house, chopping wood. Leo glances at them, continues to chop 
               wood furiously. They advance.

                                     COOPER
                         Excuse me. Leo Johnson?

                                     LEO
                         Who the hell are you?

                                     TRUMAN
                         This is Special Agent Cooper of the 
                         FBI, Leo. He'd like to ask you a 
                         couple questions.

                                     LEO
                         So?

                                     TRUMAN
                         So behave.

               Leo stops chopping, glares at Truman. But he just returns 
               it. Leo mutters, resumes chopping.

                                     LEO
                         So ask.

                                     COOPER
                         Leo. Is that short for Leonard?

                                     LEO
                         That's a question?

                                     COOPER
                         Did you know Laura Palmer?

                                     LEO
                         No.

                                     COOPER
                         How well did you know her?

                                     LEO
                         I said I didn't.

                                     COOPER
                         You're lying.

                                     LEO
                         I knew who she was, all right? 
                         Everybody did.

                                     COOPER
                         Do you have a criminal record, Leo?

                                     LEO
                         Nothing. You can look it up.

                                     COOPER
                              (he already did)
                         A speeding ticket. April, 1986. A 
                         second moving violation, illegal U-
                         turn. September, 1988--

                                     LEO
                         I paid my debt to society.

                                     COOPER
                              (beat)
                         Where were you the night of Laura 
                         Palmer's murder? Around midnight.

                                     LEO
                              (pleased with his 
                              alibi)
                         On the road. I called my wife Shelly 
                         about that time. From Butte.

                                     COOPER
                         She'll confirm that?

                                     LEO
                         She will if you ask her.

               Leo suddenly stops chopping, sticks the axe deep into the 
               wood. He looks at Cooper and Truman, unafraid. Cooper and 
               Truman look at each other.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               "INVITATION TO LOVE" - "NIGHT"

               START CLOSE on a television screen, lush MUSIC over a robin's 
               egg blue background, the familiar voice intoning:

                                     ANNOUNCER
                         ...and every hour holds the promise 
                         of an... INVITATION TO LOVE...

               FADE UP ON insolent tough guy MONTANA in t-shirt and leather 
               jacket. Luscious EMERALD eyeing him like a cool drink of 
               water. And ineffectual CHET.

                                     EMERALD
                         So, Montana, did you find that rainbow 
                         you were looking for?

                                     MONTANA
                         Lots of rainbows. No pot of gold.

                                     CHET
                         I'm not sure how I'm feeling about 
                         this.

                                     EMERALD
                         Chet, get Montana a drink. He must 
                         be thirsty after a year in the rain 
                         forest.

               Emerald sashays across the living room, steps lightly into 
               Montana's arms. She offers him a welcome kiss--a little too 
               ardently for Chet's liking.

                                     CHET
                         How long are you planning to stay, 
                         Montana?

               Montana looks up from Emerald's beestung lips.

                                     MONTANA
                         Long enough to see my ex-wife; how 
                         is Jade, Chet?

               Chet shivers. The music swells.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PALMER HOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY

               ANOTHER ANGLE reveals a television in the Palmer house. A 
               NURSE turns her eyes from the screen, withdraws a syringe 
               from Leland Palmer's arm. She discards the empty, carefully 
               draws medication into a second syringe, and places it on a 
               tray. Just then: the doorbell RINGS.

               STAY WITH Leland as the nurse walks to the front door. Leland 
               watches television.

                                                                  INTERCUT:

               "INVITATION TO LOVE"

               JARED, distinguished in smoking jacket and ascot, weeps, 
               finishes a suicide note addressed to Emerald and Jade. He 
               takes a gun into his hands, lifts it slowly. Suddenly: someone 
               knocks at the door, calls to him.

                                     JADE'S VOICE
                         Daddy! Open up! Daddy it's jade!

               Jared pauses, looks at the door, the gun. Music swells.

               DURING ABOVE, we HEAR the Palmer's front door open, some 
               muted exchange, two sets of footsteps returning to the living 
               room. Finally:

                                     MADELEINE'S VOICE
                         Uncle Leland?

               Leland looks up, sees the Nurse and MADELEINE FERGUSON 
               standing before him. Madeleine is twenty, quite beautiful, 
               She wear glasses, has jet black hair worn long. She sets 
               down a suitcase. A closer angle REVEALS that she looks very 
               much like Laura Palmer.

               Leland stares at Madeleine for a long beat. As if he didn't 
               recognize her. Then, with great difficulty:

                                     LELAND
                         Madelaine?
                              (rises, steps closer, 
                              takes her by the 
                              hands)
                         Maddy?

                                     MADELEINE
                         Uncle Leland, I'm so sorry, I...

               Madeleine pauses, a sob catches in her throat. She begins to 
               cry. Leland carefully wipes a tear from her deep blue eyes. 
               Madeleine looks up at him, whispers:

                                     MADELEINE
                         Oh Uncle Leland...

               Leland takes her into a healing embrace. He's crying too. 
               HOLD ON them for a beat.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               "INVITATION TO LOVE" - "NIGHT"

               Jared holds the gun in his hands, listens to his daughter's 
               tearful pleading.

                                     JADE
                         Daddy! Daddy please!

               Finally, Jared sets the gun on his desk, steps to the door. 
               He opens it. And JADE, his beautiful, compassionate, perfect 
               daughter leaps into his arms. She is Emerald's twin.

                                     JADE
                         Oh Daddy. I was so afraid. I love 
                         you Daddy.

               HOLD on father and daughter for a beat.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HAYWARD HOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Doc Hayward steps into the living room, dressed for the 
               funeral save for the tie which hangs undone around his neck. 
               Donna waits for him. She looks at his tie, manages a small 
               smile.

                                     DONNA
                         Dad, you're hopeless.

               Donna knots her father's tie. She does not speak. Her eyes 
               are red from crying. Hayward takes a look at his daughter, 
               consoles:

                                     HAYWARD
                         Want to talk about it?

                                     DONNA
                         Oh, Dad, I... I can't believe they're 
                         burying Laura today. It's so... final. 
                         I think and I think and it just 
                         doesn't make sense.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Death never does.

                                     DONNA
                              (tearful)
                         So what are we supposed to do?

                                     HAYWARD
                              (after a beat)
                         I live with death and dying every 
                         day. There are times when it's 
                         merciful, almost a relief. But often 
                         it seems nothing but needless and 
                         cruel. It made me furious, for many 
                         years. Furious and helpless. As you 
                         go through life, you learn to accept 
                         it. Because we have to. Even when it 
                         hurts bad enough to break your heart.

                                     DONNA
                         My heart is breaking. And I don't 
                         know how to stop it.

               Donna looks up at her father. Her eyes are bright with tears. 
               Father and daughter embrace.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BRIGGS DINING ROOM - DAY

               BOBBY BRIGGS sits at the dining room table, smoking a 
               cigarette. Quiet, seemingly downcast. But his eyes are angry 
               and cold. He wears dark funeral clothes, a tie. Bobby turns, 
               finds MAJOR BRIGGS standing across the room.

                                     MAJOR BRIGGS
                         Robert, this may be a good time for 
                         a brief discussion.

                                     BOBBY
                         You want to talk about cigarettes? 
                         Today?

                                     MAJOR BRIGGS
                         No. But put it out. It's a filthy 
                         habit, especially for a varsity 
                         athlete.

               Bobby grinds out the cigarette in an ashtray. He glowers. 
               Major Briggs sits next to him, places a hand on Bobby's knee. 
               He means well, but physical affection does not come naturally 
               to him. It feels a little forced.

                                     MAJOR BRIGGS
                         I've attended my share of funerals. 
                         Too many. Any man who dies in war 
                         dies too soon. Laura died too soon 
                         as well.

                                     BOBBY
                         Yeah. She did.

                                     MAJOR BRIGGS
                         But we have a responsibility to the 
                         dead, Robert. Responsibility is the 
                         linchpin that binds our society 
                         together. Each man responsible for 
                         his actions, each action contributing 
                         to the greater good.

                                     BOBBY
                         What's the good of putting somebody 
                         in the ground?

                                     MAJOR BRIGGS
                         It is man's way of achieving closure. 
                         In ceremony begins understanding, 
                         and the will to carry on without 
                         those we must leave behind. And 
                         Robert, in your life, you must learn, 
                         will learn, to carry on without them.

                                     BOBBY
                              (whispered)
                         Great.

                                     MAJOR BRIGGS
                         I know you experience a certain 
                         reluctance to enter fully into 
                         meaningful exchange. That leads to 
                         stalemate, and a desire on my part 
                         to force certain wisdom upon you. 
                         That's not necessarily a bad thing, 
                         sometimes it is the best course 
                         available.

               Briggs pauses, rethinks. Then, a direct emotional statement...

                                     MAJOR BRIGGS
                         Son. Don't be afraid. We'll all be 
                         there together.

               Bobby takes a closer look at his father. These are words he 
               understands. But they have absolutely nothing to do with the 
               way he's feeling.

                                     BOBBY
                         Afraid of what?

                                     MAJOR BRIGGS
                         The funeral.

                                     BOBBY
                         I'm not afraid of any damn funeral. 
                         Afraid? I can hardly wait. Afraid? 
                         I'm gonna turn it upside--down.

               The anger pours out of him. For once Major Briggs is 
               speechless. But no matter, just then BETTY BRIGGS steps into 
               the room, and, with a too bright smile...

                                     BETTY
                         Everybody ready?

               Father and son turn jaundiced eyes her way.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. POLICE STATION RECEPTION AREA - DAY

               Cooper and Sheriff Truman step through the station reception 
               area. DEPUTY TOMMY THE HAWK appears, keeps pace beside them.

                                     COOPER
                         Deputy Hawk.

                                     HAWK
                         Agent Cooper. No sign of the man 
                         with one arm.

                                     COOPER
                         Keep trying, Deputy. He's out there 
                         somewhere.

               Cooper and Truman continue towards the conference room.

                                     TRUMAN
                         If anyone can find him, Hawk can.

                                     COOPER
                         Tracker?

                                     TRUMAN
                         The best.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. INTERROGATION ROOM A - DAY

               Cooper and Truman enter. Albert Rosenfield sits at the table, 
               with a huge file of test results. He refuses to acknowledge 
               Truman's presence. Not even a glare.

                                     COOPER
                         Okay, Albert, what've you got?

                                     ALBERT
                         Enough evidence to save your butt 
                         and get mine out of this godforsaken 
                         berg.

                                     COOPER
                         We're all ears.

               Albert considers hurling an insult, instead tosses a glassine 
               envelope on the table.

                                     ALBERT
                         Contents of envelope found in Palmer 
                         diary. Cocaine. Toxicology results 
                         also positive. The little lady had a 
                         habit.
                              (throws a second 
                              envelope)
                         Fibers of twine embedded in her wrists 
                         and upper arms. Two different kinds 
                         of twine.
                              (another envelope)
                         Fibers of twine found in the railroad 
                         car, a match to the sample from the 
                         wrist. The same twine was used to 
                         bind the wrists of the Pulaski girl. 
                         My conclusion, she was tied up twice 
                         at different locations on the night 
                         of her death. Once here.
                              (he points to his 
                              wrists)
                         Once here. Like this.

               He gestures to his upper arms, pulls them back into an 
               uncomfortable position. Like in Cooper's dream.

                                     COOPER
                              (quietly)
                         Sometimes my arms bend back.

               Truman glances at him, intrigued. Albert reveals another 
               glassine.

                                     ALBERT
                         Traces of pumice in standing water 
                         outside the railroad car, suggesting 
                         soap. The kind used for heavy 
                         cleaning. Same pumice particles appear 
                         on the back of Laura's neck. Not her 
                         home-use brand. My conclusion: the 
                         killer washed his hands and leaned 
                         in for a kiss... like this.

               He demonstrates. Truman is disturbed by the implication.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Lord...

               Albert shows them a photo.

                                     ALBERT
                         Distinctive wounds on Laura's 
                         shoulders and neck. Appear to be 
                         claw marks, bites of some kind.

                                     TRUMAN
                         An animal?

                                     ALBERT
                         It's trying to think. How quaint.

               Cooper silences Albert with a stern look. Albert produces 
               another envelope.

                                     ALBERT
                         A small plastic fragment from her 
                         stomach, partially dissolved by 
                         digestive acids. I'm taking it with 
                         me back to the lab for reconstruction, 
                         as the local facilities give new 
                         meaning to the word 'primitive.'
                              (closes the file with 
                              some fanfare)
                         Those are the highlights. I'm not 
                         entirely displeased, but a couple 
                         more days with the body and who knows 
                         what I might have come up with--

                                     COOPER
                         Good work, Albert.

               Just then, Deputy Andy enters, dressed in funeral blues.

                                     ANDY
                         Sheriff. Time to go?

                                     COOPER
                         Albert, you'll excuse us. We've got 
                         to get to a funeral.

               Truman and Andy head out. Cooper moves to follow. But Albert 
               calls after him:

                                     ALBERT
                         Cooper? May I have a word with you? 
                         Alone?

               Cooper nods to Truman and Andy. They exit. Albert pulls out 
               a document.

                                     ALBERT
                         One more item.
                              (he slides it across 
                              the table)
                         A report concerning the physical 
                         assault on my person which you 
                         witnessed this morning. I think you'll 
                         find it accurate. It requires your 
                         signature.

               Cooper reads through the report with amazing speed. A beat, 
               then:

                                     COOPER
                         Albert, I'm not going to sign this--

                                     ALBERT
                              (shocked)
                         What?

                                     COOPER
                         Albert, I hope you can hear this. 
                         I've only been in Twin Peaks a short 
                         time. But in that time, I have seen 
                         decency, honor, and dignity. I have 
                         seen grief to break your heart. Murder 
                         is not a faceless event here. It's 
                         not a statistic to be tallied up at 
                         the end of every day. Laura Palmer's 
                         death has affected each and every 
                         man, woman, and child. Because life 
                         has meaning here. Every life. And 
                         that's a way of living I thought had 
                         vanished from this earth. It hasn't, 
                         Albert. It's right here in Twin Peaks.

                                     ALBERT
                         Sounds like you've been snacking on 
                         some of the local mushrooms.

               Cooper sets the report on the table, carefully pushes it 
               back to Albert.

                                     COOPER
                         With your behavior towards these 
                         good people, count yourself lucky I 
                         don't file a report of my own that 
                         could bury you so deep in a building 
                         in Washington you'll never see the 
                         sun.

               Albert turns pale, collects his papers, exits without another 
               word. Cooper looks out the window, produces his miniature 
               tape recorder, speaks into it.

                                     COOPER
                         Diane, it's 12:27 PM. I'd like you 
                         to check into my pension plan options 
                         regarding outside real estate 
                         investment. I'm thinking of purchasing 
                         some property at what I assume will 
                         be a very reasonable price.

               Cooper stops recording, pauses to ponder.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               OPEN ON a lovely smalltown cemetery, the usual weathered 
               headstones. ANOTHER ANGLE reveals Laura Palmer's burial site. 
               The freshly dug grave. A hydraulic frame used to lower the 
               casket. And two WORKERS testing the hydraulics, one sitting 
               on the coffin bed, the other raising and lowering it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A gleaming hearse in the cemetery parking lot. A mortician 
               supervises the unloading of Laura's casket, for transfer to 
               the grave. MUSIC over.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ED HURLEY'S HOUSE - DAY

               ED HURLEY steps into the living room wearing an ill-fitting 
               dark suit. He takes but three strides before Nadine appears 
               in a flurry, leaps into his arms. She nearly knocks him off 
               his feet. Ed endures an embrace of lengthy duration, Nadine 
               snuffling about his ear. Finally, she steps back, beaming, 
               out of her mind:

                                     NADINE
                         Love me?

                                     ED
                              (wildly uncertain)
                         Why sure, Nadine.

                                     NADINE
                         How do I look?

               Nadine's wearing a faded black dress. Her idea of funeral 
               clothes. The buttons are incorrectly fastened. Ed looks at 
               the dress, Nadine's manic smile.

                                     ED
                         You look fine, Nadine.

                                     NADINE
                         Last night was wonderful, Ed. You 
                         came back to me. Now we're together 
                         again. Not that we weren't, but now 
                         I feel like we're really together.

               Nadine leaps back into his arms. Ed receives her with stunned 
               expression.

                                     NADINE
                         At high school, I used to watch Norma 
                         and you at those football games? She 
                         was so pretty. You were such a 
                         handsome couple, but I knew, I always 
                         knew once you got to know me that 
                         we'd be together. Even though I was 
                         just a little nobody, a little brown 
                         mouse, I was always hoping... and 
                         wasn't I right? Wasn't I right?

               Nadine pauses, the memories come and go. She looks up at Ed, 
               back in the moment:

                                     NADINE
                         Do you remember?

               Nadine's mind spins and shifts, it's slowly slipping away. 
               And Ed doesn't know what the hell to do about it. So he 
               reaches out to her, carefully redoes the top two buttons on 
               her dress. Nadine's got them reversed.

                                     ED
                              (gently)
                         Sure, Nadine. I remember.

                                     NADINE
                              (smiles, a blank)
                         What's that?

               Just then: the sound of a motorcycle outside. Not knowing 
               what else to do, Ed goes to the window.

                                     ED
                         James.

               A beat. James enters. But he's wearing jeans and a leather 
               jacket. Ed frowns.

                                     ED
                         You ready? I don't want to be late.

                                     JAMES
                         I'm not going.

                                     ED
                         What do you mean you're not going. 
                         It's Laura.

                                     JAMES
                         I'm not going. I can't.

                                     ED
                         James--

               Too late. James turns and walks out the door. Big Ed makes 
               no move to follow.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GREAT NORTHERN CORRIDOR - DAY

               Dressed for the funeral, Audrey moves down a corridor in the 
               hotel residence wing, STOPS to peak into...

                                                                  INTERCUT:

               AUDREY'S POV - INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - DAY

               JOHNNIE HORNE sits on the floor, attired in an expensive 
               suit. DR. LAWRENCE JACOBY kneels at his feet, whispers 
               urgently to the boy, trying to convince him to remove the 
               familiar Indian headdress.

               Audrey watches from outside the doorway, listens to Jacoby 
               whisper and cajole. She can see tears glistening in the 
               doctor's eyes.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BLACK LAKE CEMETERY - DAY

               A flowered trellis stands at the entrance from the parking 
               lot to the burial grounds. The LOG LADY arrives wearing a 
               surprisingly appropriate funeral dress, clutching her log to 
               her breast. She steps among mourners as they emerge from 
               automobiles. Cooper, Sheriff Truman, and Deputies Andy and 
               Hawk get out of the police cruiser, join the throng.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BLACK LAKE CEMETERY - DAY

               Mourners step through the trellis into the cemetery proper. 
               Doc Hayward escorts Donna onto the green grass, she pauses, 
               sees Mike waiting for her nearby.

                                     MIKE
                         Hi.

                                     DONNA
                              (to father)
                         Just a sec.

               Donna steps away from her father, walks to Mike. She looks 
               at him, says nothing. An awkward beat, then:

                                     MIKE
                         Hey. I'm sorry about the other night. 
                         I didn't mean anything.
                              (reaches for her, she 
                              pulls away)
                         Hey, I said I was sorry...

                                     DONNA
                         I don't want to see you anymore, 
                         Mike. Please don't bother me again.

               Mike watches, shellshocked, as she walks away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BLACK LAKE CEMETERY - DAY

               Ed escorts Nadine through the cemetery. He sees Donna 
               returning to her father.

                                     ED
                         Go on ahead, Nadine. I'll catch up.

               Nadine seems uneasy, a little lost.

                                     ED
                         I promise. It'll be fine.

               Nadine nods, reassured, moves off. Ed steps toward Donna, 
               intercepts.

                                     ED
                         Hello, Donna.

                                     DONNA
                         Where's...?

                                     ED
                         He's not coming. He wouldn't.

                                     DONNA
                         Why?

               Ed can only shrug. Donna sees her father waiting, there's no 
               rime to talk. She's upset, tries to hide it and walks on.

                                     NORMA'S VOICE
                         Ed?

               Ed turns, finds Norma standing behind him. She's troubled.

                                     NORMA
                         Hi.

                                     ED
                              (an uneasy glance 
                              around)
                         Not the best place to talk.

                                     NORMA
                         I know. Hank's parole hearing is 
                         tomorrow. He could be out next week. 
                         Maybe sooner.

               Ed nods. He doesn't want to talk about it here. She sees 
               Nadine standing nearby and realizes why.

                                     NORMA
                              (not catty)
                         Nadine looks nice.

                                     ED
                         Yeah. She's feeling good today.

               There's sympathy in his voice, sadness too. Norma understands. 
               Ed manages a smile and moves off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BLACK LAKE CEMETERY - DAY

               Lastly, Ben Horne escorts Leland and SARAH PALMER into the 
               cemetery. Mourners stop and stare. Sarah squints in the 
               sunlight, clutches Leland's hand. And Madeleine Ferguson 
               walks behind them, wearing dark glasses.

               Ben spots Catherine nearby. He nods to Madeleine, allows her 
               to escort Leland and Sarah ahead. Ben remains, waits for 
               Catherine to join him.

                                     CATHERINE
                              (as they walk, aside)
                         Taking care of the Palmers, are we?

                                     BEN
                         It's the only decent thing to do.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Had to shut down the mill again. All 
                         that grief. 'Few more tragedies it'll 
                         roll over and play dead.

                                     BEN
                         See you at the funeral.

               Ben and Catherine separate, poker-faced.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. LAURA'S GRAVESITE - DAY

               Mourners gather around the grave. Laura's burnished casket 
               sits on its hydraulic bed, the dark hole beneath it. And 
               FATHER CLARENCE prepares his oration. Father Clarence is an 
               old man, red-faced; he fumbles with a number of prayer books 
               and hymnals. This is no ordinary service for him. He is as 
               deeply saddened as those who wait for him to comfort them.

                                     FATHER CLARENCE
                         I am the resurrection and the life, 
                         saith the Lord; he that believeth in 
                         me, though he were dead, yet shall 
                         he live; and whosoever liveth and 
                         believeth in me shall never die.

               In the distance, a lone figure steps through headstones toward 
               the grave. James Hurley. He walks closer, eyes locked on 
               Laura's casket. Bobby sees him coming, darkens, scowls. Donna 
               sees James too. She finds Bobby in the throng, notes his 
               fury. And so begins, as Father Clarence continues, a CHAIN 
               OF GLANCES.

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         For none of us liveth to himself, 
                         and no man dieth to himself. For if 
                         we live, we live unto the Lord; and 
                         if we die, we die unto the Lord.

               Donna looks to Sheriff Truman for help.

               But Sheriff Truman is looking at Josie.

               Josie meets his gaze. Then looks away, as if too shy to stare 
               at him here.

               Josie turns to Pete Martell. Pete nods, ever sociable.

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                              (over glances)
                         Whether we live, therefore, or die, 
                         we are the Lord's. Blessed are the 
                         dead who die in the Lord; even so 
                         saith the Spirit, for they rest from 
                         their labors. The Lord be with you...

                                     ALL
                         And with thy spirit.

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         Let us pray.

               Pete turns from Josie, looks to his wife.

               But Catherine is leering at Ben Horne.

               Ben returns her gaze, but is jostled by Bobby shoving past 
               him toward the grave.

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         0 God, entrust this child Laura to 
                         thy never-failing care and love, and 
                         bring us all to thy heavenly kingdom; 
                         through the same thy Son Jesus Christ 
                         our Lord, who liveth and reigneth 
                         with thee and the Holy Spirit, one 
                         God, now and forever. Amen.

               Father Clarence clears his throat. But before he can continue, 
               Johnny Home brays out a rather ill-timed:

                                     JOHNNY
                         Amen!

                                     FATHER CLARENCE
                         Thank you, Johnny.

               THE CHAIN OF GLANCES CONTINUES:

               Shelly spots Bobby, sees his anger, follows his stare to 
               James.

               James is looking at Donna, seeking comfort, approval.

               But Donna, having witnessed Bobby's fury, now looks to Big 
               Ed for help.

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         I baptized Laura Palmer. I instructed 
                         her in Sunday school. And like all 
                         of you, I came to love her with that 
                         special love we reserve for the 
                         headstrong and bold. Laura was bright, 
                         beautiful, charming. But most of all 
                         she was, I think, impatient. Impatient 
                         for her life to begin, for the rest 
                         of the world to catch up with her 
                         many dreams and ambitions.

               Big Ed doesn't notice Donna's distress. He's busy trying to 
               get Norma's attention.

               Norma doesn't see him. She's looking at Nadine.

               Nadine, oblivious as always, is gazing intently at Leland 
               and Sarah Palmer, Madeleine beside them. Nadine wipes tears 
               from her eye.

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         If we appear to put those dreams to 
                         rest today, do not believe it. For 
                         those of us who loved her, those 
                         dreams will never die. They live on 
                         inside each of us.

                                     JOHNNY'S VOICE
                              (as ill-timed as before)
                         Amen!

               Madeleine looks up, sees Nadine peering at her from across 
               the grave.

               Madeleine looks away, only to find Audrey staring at her 
               from the other side.

               Audrey notes the resemblance to Laura, reacts.

               Audrey looks to find Agent Cooper in the throng, she wants 
               him to see it too.

               And as for Cooper, he's been watching this chain from the 
               start, fascinated by all the connections and clues it offers 
               him.

               Suddenly Cooper frowns. He sees Bobby Briggs plowing through 
               the crowd, stepping quickly toward Father Clarence, the grave.

                                     CLARENCE'S VOICE
                         Laura used to tell me that I talked 
                         too much. I won't make that mistake 
                         here. It is enough to say that I 
                         loved her, and will miss her for the 
                         rest of my days.

                                     JOHNNYS VOICE
                              (getting into his own 
                              call and response 
                              rhythm)
                         Amen!!

               Bobby steps to the front of the gravesite, nearly howls the 
               repetition:

                                     BOBBY
                         AMEN!!!

               Everything stops. Bobby confronts the grave and the gathered 
               mourners with grief and rage.

                                     BOBBY
                         What are you looking at? What are 
                         you waiting for? You make me sick. 
                         You damn hypocrites make me sick. 
                         Everybody knew she was in trouble. 
                         But we didn't do a thing. Who killed 
                         the Prom Queen?! You did. We all 
                         did. And pretty words won't bring 
                         her back. Keep your prayers. Laura 
                         doesn't need them. She would've 
                         laughed at them anyway

               Bobby's cracking up, tears pool in his eyes. James moves to 
               stop him. Mike hurries forward, ready to fight. Bobby sees 
               James approaching, he leaps in his direction.

               But Cooper gets there first, Truman, Andy, and Hawk close 
               behind. They pull the boys apart, stop the fight before it 
               happens. Amidst the shouting and commotion, Johnny Horne 
               lifts his head toward the sky, lets out an atavistic howl:

                                     JOHNNY
                         Ahoooooooooooh!!

               Audrey rushes to comfort him. The howl, the brawl, all 
               contribute to a growing sense of chaos, trouble and grief in 
               the air. Major Briggs grabs his son and drags him away from 
               the grave as Bobby screams at James:

                                     BOBBY
                         I'll get you! You're dead! I'll get 
                         you!

               And now, unnoticed for the moment, Leland Palmer lets go of 
               his wife's hand, steps quietly toward the casket. He stares 
               at it for a long beat, the tumult erupting all around him. 
               Then, quite suddenly, without warning...

               Leland Palmer leaps onto the casket, shouting and wailing...

                                     LELAND
                         Laura! Laura!

               Gasps of shock. Truman and Cooper step forward immediately, 
               but Leland's jump has activated the hydraulics, the casket 
               begins to sink from view. A CARETAKER frantically reverses 
               the controls, brings Leland and the casket up again. But 
               just as Truman and Cooper seem about to grab him, the casket 
               begins to descend, remains beyond their grasp.

                                     LELAND
                         Laura! My baby!

               And so it goes, the casket rising and falling, Truman and 
               Cooper now enlisting the deputies to form a human chain, the 
               mourners reacting with shock and dismay.

               And now, at long last, Sarah Palmer takes tentative steps 
               forward, her eyes seem to clear, and she shouts, roars at 
               her husband:

                                     SARAH
                         DON'T RUIN THIS TOO!!

               A sudden silence descends upon the gravesite. Sarah Palmer 
               remains frozen, Madeleine at her side. Mourners glance at 
               each other, begin to disperse. The funeral of Laura Palmer 
               has concluded.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                      END ACT THREE

                                         ACT FOUR

               FADE IN:

               EXT. DOUBLE R DINER - NIGHT

               Nightfall at the Double R.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DOUBLE R DINER - NIGHT

               OPEN ON a pair of hands, female, acting out a pantomime on 
               the Double R counter. One hand, palm down, held out straight, 
               suggests a coffin/platform. The other, two fingers pointed 
               down, skips across the counter, suggesting leaping feet. In 
               this manner, accompanied by buzzing lips approximating the 
               sound of hydraulics, Shelly Johnson reenacts the funeral 
               imbroglio. Her fingers skip across the counter, leap upon 
               the coffin, and BZZZZZ, the hydraulics go up and down and up 
               and down...

               ANOTHER ANGLE reveals Shelly in the Double R. She's 
               entertaining several old coots at the counter, demonstrating 
               Leland Palmer's leap onto the casket--and into local lore. 
               Norma passes by, frowns.

               Shelly puts her hands behind her back as if to promise no 
               more finger puppets. But the moment Norma moves on, she's at 
               it again, fingers flying, lips buzzing, much to the delight 
               of the crusty old regulars.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DOUBLE R DINER - NIGHT

               Sheriff Truman, Big Ed Hurley, and Deputy Hawk share a booth 
               in the back, drinking coffee and eating pie. They speak just 
               above a whisper. They're trading secrets, not funeral gossip. 
               In mid-conversation:

                                     TRUMAN
                         Maybe we should tell him.

                                     HAWK
                         Why?

                                     TRUMAN
                         I feel bad keeping him in the dark. 
                         What the hell, he's going to figure 
                         it our sooner or later anyway.

                                     ED
                         Don't be so sure.

                                     TRUMAN
                              (looking over Ed's 
                              shoulder)
                         Want to bet?

               Truman SEES Cooper enter the diner, step toward their booth.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Right on time.

                                     ED
                              (sotto voce)
                         Careful who you trust, Harry. He's 
                         not one of us.

                                     COOPER
                         Evening, Harry. Ed, Hawk.

               Truman gestures to the space beside him. Cooper sits down.

                                     COOPER
                         I got your note. What's up?

               Ed signals to Norma, she steps over to take Cooper's order.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Agent Cooper, how would you like 
                         some fresh huckleberry pie?

                                     COOPER
                         I would love some huckleberry pie.
                              (for Norma's benefit)
                         Heated. Vanilla ice cream on the 
                         side. Coffee.

                                     NORMA
                         Coming right up.

               Norma steps away. Cooper turns to Ed.

                                     COOPER
                         How long have you been in love with 
                         Norma?

               Ed blanches, says nothing. Truman turns to him.

                                     TRUMAN
                         See what I mean?

               Ed nods. Cooper takes note of the exchange, looks to Hawk, 
               Sheriff Truman.

                                     COOPER
                         There's something you fellas want to 
                         tell me.

                                     ED
                              (a convert)
                         Better tell him.

               Hawk nods assent. A beat. Sheriff Truman begins:

                                     TRUMAN
                         Someone's running drugs into Twin 
                         Peaks from over the border. We've 
                         been working undercover, trying to 
                         set up a bust: top to bottom. Nobody 
                         walks.

                                     COOPER
                         Who's targeted?

                                     TRUMAN
                         Jacques Renault, bartender at the 
                         Roadhouse, we figure him for the 
                         middleman. Ed was staking him out 
                         the night you got into town. Renault 
                         slipped something into his drink.

                                     ED
                         Felt like somebody hit me on the 
                         head with a hammer.

                                     COOPER
                         I didn't know you were a deputy, Ed.

                                     TRUMAN
                         He's not.

                                     COOPER
                         A little outside your jurisdiction, 
                         isn't it?

                                     ED
                         Somebody's sellin' drugs to high 
                         school kids. That's in everybody's 
                         jurisdiction.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I call on Ed when I need him. He's 
                         not the only one I call.

               Just then: Norma arrives with Cooper's pie and coffee.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Thank you, Norma.

                                     NORMA
                         Enjoy.

               Cooper digs in, gives Norma a hearty thumbs-up. Norma smiles, 
               walks away.

                                     COOPER
                         This must be where pies go when they 
                         die.

               Cooper takes another bite. Sheriff Truman waits for some 
               reaction to all he's told him. Finally, Cooper sets down his 
               fork, begins:

                                     COOPER
                         Someone's bringing, drugs into Twin 
                         Peaks. Laura Palmer was on drugs. 
                         You call on Ed to help you out. Ed's 
                         a good man. Local bartender's a mid-
                         level player, okay, it's hard to get 
                         by on minimum wage. Now Harry, please. 
                         What is it you really want to tell 
                         me?

               Sheriff Truman looks at the others. They encourage him to 
               continue

                                     TRUMAN
                         You're going to have to trust me. No 
                         matter how it sounds.

                                     COOPER
                         I trust you, Harry.

                                     TRUMAN
                              (after a beat, looking 
                              for words)
                         Twin Peaks is different. A long way 
                         from the world. You've noticed that.

                                     COOPER
                         Indeed I have.

                                     TRUMAN
                         And that's the way we like it. But 
                         there's a back end to that that's 
                         different too. Maybe that's the price 
                         we pay for all the good things.

                                     COOPER
                         What is it?

                                     TRUMAN
                              (lowering his voice)
                         There's a sort of evil out there. 
                         Something strange in the hills. It 
                         takes different forms, but it's been 
                         there for as long as anyone can 
                         remember. And we've always been here 
                         to fight it.

                                     COOPER
                         "We?"

                                     TRUMAN
                         Men before us. Men before them. More 
                         after we're gone. We protect our 
                         own. We have to.

                                     COOPER
                              (relishing this)
                         A secret society.

               The others exchange looks.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Let's take Agent Cooper for a little 
                         ride.

                                     COOPER
                         Where to?

                                     TRUMAN
                         The Book House.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE ROADHOUSE - NIGHT

               A dusty parking lot surrounds the slightly seedy honky tonk. 
               Behind it, another, smaller structure. The Book House. Sheriff 
               Truman and the others arrive in a cruiser and a patrol car, 
               exit. Cooper takes a deep breath of cool night air.

                                     TRUMAN
                         This way.

               Truman leads Cooper towards the Book House.

                                     COOPER
                         How long have you been Sheriff, Harry?

                                     TRUMAN
                         Five years.

                                     COOPER
                         How long have you been meeting here?

                                     TRUMAN
                         Longer than that.
                              (they, reach the door)
                         It's a funny thing. Seems like every 
                         time you solve a mystery, there's 
                         another one right behind it.

               Cooper smiles. He can appreciate that sort of thinking.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BOOK HOUSE NIGHT

               They enter. It is a clubhouse of sorts, chairs and tables, a 
               comfortable atmosphere. And walls lined with bookshelves, 
               tomes on every imaginable topic. Cooper stops, reacts. There's 
               a burly hirsute MAN, wearing a gag, tied to a chair at the 
               center of the room. James Hurley and JOEY PAULSON stand guard.

                                     TRUMAN
                         You know James. Joey Paulson.

                                     JAMES
                         Hello, Agent Cooper.

                                     COOPER
                         Hello, James. Joey. Who's this?

                                     TRUMAN
                         Bernard Renault. Jacques' brother. 
                         Janitor had at the roadhouse. Bernard 
                         had an ounce of cocaine in his kit 
                         bag. Thought we'd ask him a couple 
                         questions.

               Cooper nods, getting into the spirit. Truman removes Bernard's 
               gag.

                                     COOPER
                              (after a beat)
                         Did you ever sell drugs to Laura 
                         Palmer?

                                     BERNARD
                              (French-Canadian)
                         I don't sell drugs.

                                     TRUMAN
                         How much does Jacques pay you to be 
                         the mule?

                                     BERNARD
                         Jacques don't pay me nothing, I'm no 
                         mule.

                                     TRUMAN
                         So that ounce we found, that was for 
                         personal use?

                                     BERNARD
                         That's right.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Where's your brother been? Not at 
                         work the last few days.

                                     BERNARD
                         I don't know. He got business.

                                     COOPER
                         With who?

                                     BERNARD
                         I don't know.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Who else does Jacques work with?

                                     BERNARD
                         Why don't you ask him yourself? He 
                         be back tonight. Any minute.

                                     TRUMAN
                         He's coming to work?

                                     BERNARD
                              (stating the obvious)
                         He the bartender, isn't he?

               Bernard grins, triumphant. Cooper looks at Truman, steps 
               closer.

                                     COOPER
                         Bernard, we have you tied up in a 
                         chair. You're mixed up in a wide 
                         variety of felonies with your brother. 
                         What I want to know is, why in the 
                         world would you tell us when and 
                         where to find him?

               That wipes the grin off his face. Bernard looks at his feet, 
               says nothing. Cooper doesn't mind. He already knows the 
               answer.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

               JACQUES RENAULT walks down a country road, peers through the 
               dark at the Roadhouse in the distance. Jacques stops suddenly, 
               reacts.

               JACQUES' POV - THE ROADHOUSE

               There's a redlight on top of the honky-tonk, it shines and 
               blinks a warning. Jacques takes one look at it, knows what 
               it means. He turns and runs as fast as he can in the opposite 
               direction.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Leo stands over the kitchen sink, carefully cleans and 
               polishes a pair of heavy boots. The phone rings. Leo sets 
               the boots on a towel, answers it.

                                     LEO
                         Yeah?

                                                                  INTERCUT:

               EXT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

               Jacques is calling from a phone booth, breathless, sweating 
               from the run.

                                     JACQUES
                         The bust light's on. Bernard's in 
                         trouble.

                                     LEO
                         You sure?

                                     JACQUES
                         I saw it. You gotta get me out of 
                         here, Leo. Border run.

                                     LEO
                         Where are you?

                                     JACQUES
                         Phone booth by the Cash and Carry. I 
                         don't like waitin', man.

                                     LEO
                         Shut up. I'm on my way.

               Leo hangs up, grabs his jacket and a small bag. Shelly enters, 
               wonders.

                                     SHELLY
                         Where you goin'?

                                     LEO
                         You don't need to know.

               He exits. Shelly grabs her purse, kneels down in the kitchen 
               near a cabinet. Without hesitation--she's done this before--
               Shelly carefully removes some of the cabinet's slats, 
               revealing a hiding place. She reaches into the hole, pulls 
               out Leo's bloody shirt. Satisfied, she returns it, then digs 
               into her purse, removes her brand new Colt .32, looks at it 
               for a beat. Then puts it with the shirt below and replaces 
               the slats.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ROADHOUSE - NIGHT

               Cooper, Truman, Ed, and Hawk exit, Truman heads for his 
               cruiser, gets on the radio.

                                     TRUMAN
                              (to Cooper)
                         You and Hawk wait inside the 
                         Roadhouse. Ed and I'll watch the 
                         road, I'll call for some back-up.

                                     COOPER
                         Jacques' half-way to the border by 
                         now.

                                     TRUMAN
                         We don't know that yet.

               Cooper directs their attention to the blinking red light on 
               top of the Roadhouse.

                                     COOPER
                         I don't remember seeing that blinking 
                         red light before, do you?

               The others look up. Truman realizes what's up. Hangs up his 
               radio.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I'll take Bernard in and book him.

                                     ED
                         I'll give you a hand, Harry.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Hawk, why don't you run Agent Cooper 
                         back to the Great Northern?

                                     COOPER
                              (as they start off)
                         Buy you a drink, Hawk?

               Hawk nods.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. GREAT NORTHERN BAR - NIGHT

               A short time later. A sad song plays on a jukebox. Couples 
               gather on the small dance floor, a few GUESTS mingle at the 
               bar. Cooper and Hawk sit at small table near the fireplace. 
               Their mood is quiet, contemplative. It's been a long day.

                                     COOPER
                              (after a beat)
                         Did you know her, Hawk?

                                     HAWK
                         Laura? Caught her speeding a couple 
                         times. Let her talk me our of the 
                         ticket. That wasn't hard.

                                     COOPER
                         Laura Palmer didn't have to die. 
                         It's wrong. It makes me mad.

                                     HAWK
                         Everything dies.

               A beat. Cooper takes a pull from a longneck beer. He quietly 
               wonders:

                                     COOPER
                         Do you believe in the soul?

               The question takes Hawk by surprise. He takes a closer look 
               at Cooper.

                                     HAWK
                         Several.

                                     COOPER
                              (curious)
                         More than one?

                                     HAWK
                         Blackfeet legend. Waking souls that 
                         give life to mind and body. A dream 
                         soul that wanders.

                                     COOPER
                         Where does it wander?

                                     HAWK
                         Faraway places. The Land of the Dead.

                                     COOPER
                         Is that where Laura is?

                                     HAWK
                         Laura's in the ground, Agent Cooper. 
                         That's all I know for sure.

               Cooper reacts, takes a closer look. Tommy 'The Hawk' Hill, 
               agnostic Blackfoot. There's more to him than meets the eye. 
               A beat. Cooper lifts his glass into the air, proposes a toast:

                                     COOPER
                         To Laura. Godspeed.

               They touch glasses, toast. That's when Cooper sees Leland 
               Palmer stepping between tables to the dance floor.

               ON LELAND

               Leland walks onto the dance floor, stands quite still. The 
               juke selects another title. Big band music pours into the 
               room. Leland listens intently. He looks up, his eyes bright 
               with tears. A beat. Leland Palmer begins to dance.

               At first his actions go unnoticed. But gradually couples 
               turn to regard him, this sad man dancing across the floor. 
               Some giggle, others look with sympathy. Most begin to 
               disperse. But Leland keeps dancing, he pleads With those who 
               remain:

                                     LELAND
                         Dance with me. Please. Dance with 
                         me.

               As his pleadings grows more desperate, Cooper and Hawk step 
               quickly to the dance floor, mean to lead him away.

                                     COOPER
                         Mr. Palmer. Leland?

                                     HAWK
                         Mr. Palmer?

               Gradually, Leland hears them, finally focusing on them.

                                     COOPER
                         It's time to go home.

               Pause. He nods weakly, Cooper and Hawk gently lead Leland 
               between them out of the room.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. BLUE PINE LODGE - NIGHT.

               Establish. A full moon sailing overhead.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BLUE PINE LODGE KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Lights are low, a small table has been set with silver, 
               candies, and white linen. A romantic supper for two. Josie 
               wears a silk robe, something sheer beneath it. Sheriff Truman 
               wears the ardent expression of a man in love.

               Pete steps into view carrying dinner on a large platter.

                                     PETE
                         Pan-fried Rainbow. Caught 'em this 
                         morning.

               Pete serves the trout to each.

                                     JOSIE
                         Thank you, Pete.

                                     PETE
                         It's nothing. Old family recipe.

               Truman pours a little wine, offers:

                                     TRUMAN
                         Pour you a glass, Pete?

                                     PETE
                         No, no. You kids enjoy. Never mind 
                         the dishes. We'll get 'em later.

               He intends to leave them alone. Truman smiles appreciatively, 
               thanks Pete with a wink. He watches Pete step from the room. 
               A beat. Josie toys with her food, silent, preoccupied. 
               Something is troubling her. And Truman knows it.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Heart a' gold, old Pete.

                                     JOSIE
                         Yes, he is.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Josie, what's wrong?

                                     JOSIE
                         Nothing.

                                     TRUMAN
                         'Nothing.'

               Josie looks up from her dinner. Candlelight shimmers all 
               around her.

                                     TRUMAN
                         God you're beautiful.

               Josie tries to smile. But her eyes are full of fear. Truman 
               leans closer.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Josie something's wrong, I want you 
                         to tell me.

                                     JOSIE
                              (after a beat)
                         They want to hurt me. I know they 
                         do. Something horrible is going to 
                         happen, Harry.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Who? Who's going to hurt you?

                                     JOSIE
                         Ben and Catherine.

               CAMERA MOVES from the table, finally REVEALS an intercom 
               speaker on the wall, nearly out of sight, a silent ear 
               listening.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MARTELL BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Catherine Martell sits at a small desk, car pressed close to 
               an intercom console/speaker. She manipulates the volume knob, 
               listening to every word they say.

                                     JOSIE'S VOICE
                         Catherine keeps the mill account 
                         books in her safe. Two books. Two 
                         accounts.

                                     TRUMAN'S VOICE
                              (alert)
                         Two? Can you show me?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BLUE PINE LODGE OFFICE - NIGHT

               Josie leads Truman into the office, trips the hidden catch, 
               releases the false bookshelf, and reveals the wall safe. She 
               inserts the key, tugs at the handle.

                                     JOSIE
                         Why would she keep two sets of books?

                                     TRUMAN
                         The usual reasons would have something 
                         to do with stealing. Maybe more.

               Josie opens the safe, both look inside, react. There is only 
               one ledger inside.

                                     JOSIE
                         But there were two.

               Truman removes the ledger, thumbs through it.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Nothing unusual here.

                                     JOSIE
                              (whispered, trembling)
                         There were two.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MARTELL BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Catherine smiles. She's holding the other ledger in her hand. 
               Just then: footsteps, Pete enters. She slips the ledger in a 
               drawer and turns down the intercom. Pete catches this last 
               action.

                                     PETE
                              (all innocence)
                         Have you seen my tackle box?

                                     CATHERINE
                         The next time you and the merry widow 
                         want a peek in my safe, don't go to 
                         so much trouble. Be a man about it, 
                         Pete. Ask me to my face.

               Pete stares at her for a beat. He'll fight another day.

                                     PETE
                         Maybe I'll check the truck.

               Pete exits. Catherine gloats.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BLUE PINE LODGE KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Truman and Josie sit before the wood-burning stove. Josie 
               burrows into Truman's arms, shivers, speaks just above a 
               whisper, revealing her deepest fears:

                                     JOSIE
                         When Andrew died I was so alone. I 
                         couldn't think, I didn't know what 
                         to do. Catherine said she would help 
                         me. And Ben would help me too.

                                     TRUMAN
                              (figuring)
                         Ben and Catherine...

                                     JOSIE
                         They lied to me. They didn't care 
                         about Andrew. They didn't care about 
                         me. All they want is to take the 
                         mill away from me.
                              (beat)
                         I have never said this before to 
                         anyone. Harry, I believe Andrew's 
                         death was not an accident. And I 
                         believe they will try to kill me 
                         too.

               A tear runs from her eye. Truman pulls her closer, trying to 
               make some sense of this.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Josie, Josie. Nothing's going to 
                         happen to you. Not now, not ever. 
                         I'll make damn sure of that.

                                     JOSIE
                         Oh, Harry.

               Truman kisses her gently. Josie sighs, returns his kiss with 
               greater fervor. They settle into a long embrace, whisper 
               between kisses.

                                     TRUMAN
                         You don't have to be afraid.

               Josie places her head against his chest, holds on tight.

                                     TRUMAN
                              (softly continues)
                         Days like today, death feels like 
                         the biggest thing in the world. But 
                         it's not, Josie. Nor for us.

                                     JOSIE
                         I'm not afraid of death. I'm afraid 
                         of losing you.

               A beat. Josie begins to recite while trembling in his arms:

                                     JOSIE
                         All things howsoever they flourish 
                         Return to the root from which they 
                         grew. This return to the root is 
                         called Quietness; Quietness is called 
                         submission to Fate; What has submitted 
                         to Fate has become part of the always-
                         so. To know the always-so is to be 
                         Illumined; Not to know it, means to 
                         go blindly to disaster.
                              (beat)
                         He who knows the always-so has room 
                         in him for everything; He who has 
                         room in him for everything is without 
                         prejudice. To be without prejudice 
                         is to be kingly; To be kingly is to 
                         be of heaven; To be of heaven is to 
                         be in Tao. Tao is forever and he 
                         that posssess it, Though his body 
                         ceases, is not destroyed.

               HOLD ON Josie for a beat. Safe in Truman's arms.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BLACK LAKE CEMETERY - NIGHT

               Cooper stands watch at the cemetery, a night wind howling 
               about him. He peers into the dark, Laura's grave in the 
               distance. The Land of the Dead. A beat, then:

                                     CARETAKER'S VOICE
                         Can you hear 'em?

               Cooper turns to find an old CARETAKER at his side, gazing 
               out into the night.

                                     CARETAKER
                         It's the metal and the wood, I guess. 
                         Some caskets, you stick 'em in the 
                         ground, and the wood starts to expand, 
                         starts to rub against that metal. 
                         And if it rubs just so, you get a 
                         strange sort of sound. If the night's 
                         just right, and the wood--teak and 
                         brass are the best--well, it's like 
                         music. You can almost hear the caskets 
                         singin'.

               Needless to say, it's a notion Cooper finds fascinating.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. BLACK LAKE CEMETERY - NIGHT

               Minutes later. CAMERA STARTS AT GROUND LEVEL, green grass, 
               dark graves. Suddenly Cooper LOWERS INTO FRAME, presses his 
               ear to the ground. As if to listen for the casket's singing. 
               That's when he hears another sound. Footsteps, someone walking 
               toward Laura Palmer's grave.

               Cooper slips into the shadows. He watches a lone figure step 
               to Laura's grave. But he can't make out the face. At least 
               until the mystery man lights a cigarette.

               COOPER'S POV

               It is Dr. Lawrence Jacoby. He inhales deeply, stares down at 
               Laura's grave. He holds a bouquet of flowers in his free 
               hand.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BLACK LAKE CEMETERY - NIGHT

               Jacoby sets the flowers by the headstone. Cooper steps into 
               view, speaks gently.

                                     COOPER
                         Dr. Jacoby?
                              (silence)
                         I didn't see you at the funeral.

               A long beat. Jacoby finally turns to Cooper, seems to notice 
               him for the first time. Then, eyes bright with tears, he 
               whispers:

                                     JACOBY
                         I'm a terrible person, Agent Cooper. 
                         I pretend that I'm not. But I am.

               Cooper says nothing. He'll let the man talk.

                                     JACOBY
                         I listen to their problems all day. 
                         I give them advice, solutions that 
                         are supposed to "improve" their lives. 
                         These people think of me as a friend.
                              (beat)
                         But the truth is, I... I don't really 
                         care. When I'm not working I wear 
                         ear plugs so I don't have to hear 
                         them talk. Nothing... ever... touches 
                         me.
                              (beat)
                         Except for Laura.
                              (beat)
                         I couldn't come today. I just 
                         couldn't.
                              (a whisper)
                         I hope she'll understand...

               HOLD ON them for a beat. Jacoby's sad tears in the dark.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                         THE END
