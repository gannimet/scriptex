                                         ACT ONE

               In DARKNESS the sound of a meadowlark's song.

               FADE IN:

               THE MEADOWLARK

               The bright eye and beak of the bird, backlit by the first 
               light of the rising sun.

               EXT. INTERSTATE HIGHWAY "21" - DAWN

               A long, straight, empty stretch of road leads up between two 
               mountains, Whitetail and Blue Pine, the Twin Peaks.

               EXT. TWIN PEAKS TOWN SQUARE - DAWN

               The picturesque center of the town of Twin Peaks; a small, 
               neatly manicured park with a pristine white gazebo its 
               centerpiece. Fronting the park is the '30's-style streamlined, 
               concrete and glass City Hall. An early rising MAN walks two 
               Irish setters through the square.

               EXT. TWIN PEAKS DOWNTOWN - DAWN

               In the shadow of a smaller mountain Sparkwood Hill, we see 
               the slightly run down business district, the core of Twin 
               Peaks' old downtown. A slow-moving freight train rumbles 
               through the train station.

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAWN

               A quiet, tree-lined street. White, clapboard houses with 
               open porches. A MILKMAN carries a crate of clinking milk 
               bottles up the steps to one of the houses. Behind him, a 
               yellow schoolbus cruises slowly by.

               EXT. INTERSECTION - DAWN

               Where Sparkwood Road meets Highway "21", a traffic light 
               cycles from green to yellow to red.

               EXT. ED HURLEY'S GAS STATION - DAWN

               On the highway. Not yet open for business. - No sign of life.

               EXT. THE ROADHOUSE DANCE HALL - DAWN

               A dog drifts through a parking lot, littered with last night's 
               trash and beer bottles. The club's neon patron-snatcher 
               flickers back and forth between two images of a couple doing 
               the jitterbug.

               EXT. DOUBLE "R" DINER - DAWN

               Open for business. Two Diesel rigs idle in the oil-stained 
               gravel lot outside. A couple of nighthawks sober up at the 
               counter. A pretty country-western ballad plays on the jukebox 
               inside.

               EXT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - DAWN

               An imposing granite structure overlooks the city from high 
               on White Tail Mountain, one of the Twin Peaks. Automatic 
               sprinklers kick on across the vast green-black lawns.

               EXT. PACKARD SAWMILL - DAWN

               A massive industrial structure on the south shore of Black 
               Lake. Sawdust and steam shoot out of funnels and pipes. A 
               distant tug shepherds a logjam towards the sawmill gates. A 
               piercing steam whistle signals the end of the night shift.

               EXT. THE PACKARD RESIDENCE - DAWN

               Outside the huge log house, called Blue Pine Lodge, PETE 
               MARTELL, a late-middle-aged man, sets some fishing gear in 
               the back of a pick-up, then goes inside.

               INT. BLUE PINE LODGE KITCHEN - DAWN

               Pete grabs a thermos of coffee and an apple, kisses his wife, 
               KATHERINE PACKARD MARTELL, a sturdy, weathered woman, mid-
               fifties, fully dressed, at the table, newspaper and coffee 
               in hand. She doesn't react to the kiss. Pete exits.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BLUE PINE LODGE MASTER BEDROOM - DAWN.

               GIOVANNA PASQUALINI PACKARD, a beautiful woman in her 
               thirties, wearing a silk negligee, sits at a vanity table, 
               combing her hair, lost in a dreamy state of mind. From 
               outside, she hears Pete's pick-up drive off, turns to look 
               out the bedroom's large picture window.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               GIOVANNA'S POV

               Looking down to the shores of Black Lake. A large logjam is 
               visible near the sawmill dock.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SAWMILL DOCK - DAWN

               Pete lifts his fishing gear from the pick-up end walks out 
               onto the dock to drop a line.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PETE

               He's about to cast out his line when his expression changes; 
               he sees something horrible. He sets his tackle and makes his 
               way down a wooden stairway to a landing at water level. He 
               jumps across a gap of dark, oil-slicked water onto the edge 
               of a cabled log-raft. He steps cautiously across the shiny, 
               barkless logs, slowing as he approaches what it was that 
               caught his eye...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A WOMAN'S BODY

               Face down, lying on the log raft, cut, bruised, broken and 
               lifeless.

               PETE

               Shaking, he turns to go for help.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE - DAY

               Highway "21", empty, running up between the twin peaks. A 
               flying wedge of motorcycle riders driving Harleys ride into 
               view; seven young men, all between seventeen and twenty-one, 
               clean-cut, wearing black leather jackets. With MAIN TITLES 
               and MUSIC over, we see the gang ride through various parts 
               of the city.

                                        END TITLES

               FADE IN:

               EXT. SAWMILL DOCK - DAWN

               Pete, the middle-aged man, hurriedly punches in a number on 
               a pay phone at the end of the dock.

                                     PETE
                         Lucy, put Dan on the horn.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SHERIFFS OFFICE - DAWN

               SHERIFF DAN STEADMAN, rugged, early forties, pours his first 
               cup of coffee, as the dispatcher, LUCY MORAN, turns to him 
               from the switchboard.

                                     LUCY
                         Sheriff, sounds like Pete Martell up 
                         at the Mill.

               Steadman punches line one and picks up the call.

                                     STEADMAN
                         Sheriff Steadman... now hold on a 
                         second, Pete, where?... you stay 
                         right there, I'm on my way.

               He hangs up, grabs his hat and coat and heads for the door.

                                     STEADMAN
                              (to Lucy)
                         You better get Dr. Hayward, tell him 
                         to meet me up at the Packard Mill, 
                         the dock right below the dam - and 
                         roust that Andy out of bed, tell him 
                         to get his butt up there now.

                                     LUCY
                         What is it?

                                     STEADMAN
                         We got a body up there. You don't 
                         say a word to anybody till you hear 
                         from me.

               Steadman exits.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAWN

               Steadman hops into his souped-up Diamond County Sheriff's 
               Department cruiser, fires up the big V-8 and rooster-tails 
               it towards the highway, as his red and blue toplights start 
               spinning.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. PACKARD MILL DOCK - MORNING

               Steadman pulls up, lights still spinning, just as the Diamond 
               County Coroner's station wagon pulls up alongside. Steadman 
               gets out and joins DR. WILLIAM HAYWARD, the Medical Examiner, 
               a tall, distinguished gray-haired man of sixty, and they 
               move towards the dock.

                                     HAYWARD
                         What've we got?

                                     STEADMAN
                         Let's go find out.

               They make their way down the wooden steps to the log raft. 
               Waiting there are Pete, his wife Katherine and Giovanna 
               Packard, wearing a coat over a brocade bathrobe, her beautiful 
               hair and make-up in stark contrast to the harsh surroundings.

                                     PETE
                         We haven't touched anything.

                                     STEADMAN
                         Thanks, Pete.
                              (tips his hat)
                         Mrs. Packard... Katherine...

                                     KATHERINE
                         Our security guard didn't see 
                         anything.

               Steadman nods, he and Hayward move forward to the body, on 
               the edge of the logs. Without touching anything, Hayward 
               kneels beside the body and begins to examine details.

                                     HAYWARD
                         You want forensics first?

                                     STEADMAN
                              (shakes his head)
                         She's been in the water. Go ahead.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Let's get some pictures.

               Above them, on the dock, DEPUTY ANDY BRENNAN, young, 
               intelligent but awkward and shy, climbs down the stairs, 
               carrying a forensic examination kit and a camera.

                                     ANDY
                         You need the kit, Sheriff? I've got 
                         the kit.

                                     STEADMAN
                         Good. Bring that camera down here, 
                         Andy.

                                     ANDY
                         Right.
                              (as he passes the 
                              others)
                         Ladies... Pete.

                                     STEADMAN
                         Doc wants some pictures before we 
                         turn her over.

                                     ANDY
                              (staring at the body)
                         Who is she?

                                     STEADMAN
                         Andy, the camera. Then we'll turn 
                         her over and find out.

                                     ANDY
                         Sorry. Sure. Okay.

               Andy puts down the kit and shoots various angles of her back, 
               as the others stand out of the way. Andy kneels down to get 
               a closer shot, pauses, slumps back down to a sitting position 
               and starts to weep.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Oh, Andy.

                                     STEADMAN
                         My God, Andy. Same thing as Last 
                         year in Mr. Blodgett's barn.

                                     ANDY
                         Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

                                     STEADMAN
                         Is this gonna happen every damn time?

                                     HAYWARD
                         Give me the camera, Andy.

               Hayward takes the camera from him and takes some more 
               pictures. Steadman notices that a crowd of mill workers are 
               gathering above on the dock.

                                     STEADMAN
                              (giving him an out)
                         Andy, get up on the dock and dear 
                         that crowd back.

                                     ANDY
                         Okay, Dan. Sorry.

               Drying his eyes, Andy walks back and starts up the ladder.

               Hayward takes a closeup of the girl's wrist, where he's found 
               some small, distinctive wounds. He puts the camera down on 
               the forensic kit.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Let's turn her over. Give me a hand 
                         here.

               Steadman and Hayward grasp her by the shoulders and knees 
               end gently turn the body over.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE GIRL'S HEAD

               As the body turns and the face comes into view.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               STEADMAN AND HAYWARD

               Seeing the face, they're both hit with a shock of recognition.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Oh Lord. Laura...

                                     STEADMAN
                         Laura Palmer.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Sweet Jesus...

                                     GIOVANNA
                              (shocked)
                         Laura? Is it Laura?

               Steadman looks back towards the others, where Giovanna has 
               stepped forward towards them. He catches her eye. Nods.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. LAURA PALMER'S HOUSE - MORNING

               A quiet, upper middle-class neighborhood. Manicured lawns. A 
               PAPERBOY rides by on a bike, flings a paper onto the front 
               steps of the Palmer house.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PALMER HOUSE - MORNING

               SARAH PALMER, a thin, nervous chain-smoker, mid-forties, 
               turns some bacon over on the griddle, lights a cigarette and 
               goes to the bottom of the stairs.

                                     SARAH
                         Laura, sweetheart, I'm not gonna 
                         tell you again!
                              (silence; she waits)
                         Laura!
                              (no response; to 
                              herself)
                         Oh for goodness sakes...

               She starts up the stairs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PALMER HALLWAY

               Sarah opens the door to Laura's bedroom.

                                     SARAH
                              (annoyed)
                         Laura, now means now--

               She stops short. Laura's bed has apparently been slept in 
               but there's no one in the room. Sarah walks down the hall to 
               the bathroom and knocks on the door.

                                     SARAH
                         Laura?

               No answer. She tries the door, opens it. No one inside. Sarah 
               goes back into the hall, starting to worry.

                                     SARAH
                              (louder)
                         Laura! Honey, are you downstairs?

               She goes into Laura's room. Notices for the first time that 
               the window is open and the lace curtains are blowing in the 
               breeze.

               Sarah picks up the white princess phone beside Laura's bed, 
               dials and waits for someone to answer.

                                     SARAH
                              (into the phone)
                         Bette, it's Sarah, listen, I just 
                         came up to wake Laura and she's not 
                         here, is she with Bobby?

                                                                  INTERCUT:

               INT. BRIGGS HOUSE KITCHEN - MORNING

               BETTY BRIGGS, a healthy, solid woman, early forties, is on 
               the phone. Her husband, MAJOR GARLAND BRIGGS, a rock-hard 
               Air Force career man, sits at the table in background, ramrod-
               stiff, drinking black coffee.

                                     BETTY
                              (into the phone)
                         She might be, Sarah, but Bobby leaves 
                         here about five to go running and 
                         then goes on to football practice.

                                     SARAH
                         Can you reach him? Can you find out? 
                         I'll call the school--

                                     BETTY
                         I've got the number of the fieldhouse 
                         here, let me get that for you--it's 
                         474--

                                     SARAH
                              (writing it down)
                         Thanks, Bette--
                              (a new idea)
                         You know, I'm wondering if she might 
                         have gone out with Leland, he had an 
                         early meeting--

                                     BETTY
                         I'm sure that's it, or she's with 
                         Bobby--

                                     SARAH
                         Sure, let me call up to the hotel, 
                         thanks.

               She hangs up, then starts to dial another number.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               MAX HARTMAN, the genial, verbose football coach, picks up 
               the phone at the fieldhouse window. Football players are 
               practicing on the field in background.

                                     HARTMAN
                              (into the phone)
                         Yeah, hello, this is the Coach... 
                         yeah, Mrs. Palmer, no, Bobby didn't 
                         show up for practice yet, matter of 
                         fact, come to think of it, he's been 
                         late every day this week, possibly 
                         even last week and the week before, 
                         although he might be here before you 
                         know it--well, I could have him call 
                         you Mrs. Palmer, is it urgent?... 
                         okay, sure, fine.

               A group of fifteen NORWEGIAN BUSINESSMEN sit around an 
               executive dining table, talking animatedly in Norwegian while 
               consuming an immense, hearty breakfast.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL OFFICE - MORNING

               In an inner office, BENJAMIN HORNE, a roguish, charismatic 
               man, mid-forties looks in at the Norwegians, then consults 
               with his lawyer, LELAND PALMER, a handsome, refined man of 
               fifty, who takes a sheath of legal contracts from a briefcase 
               and shows them to Horne.

                                     HORNE
                              (glancing at the 
                              contracts)
                         Are they ready to sign?

                                     LELAND
                         You don't want to mention to them 
                         that we don't as yet have access to 
                         the Packard land--

                                     HORNE
                         By the time we're ready to start 
                         building we'll have that land, what 
                         they don't know won't hurt them--
                              (holds up a hand to 
                              silence him)
                         --I have solid information that the 
                         Packard Sawmill will go belly-up 
                         within a year. We will buy it for a 
                         song; one verse, no chorus.

                         where they live.

               As they move into the dining room, we MOVE to a LARGE MAP on 
               the wall, topographical of Twin Peaks and environs.

               On the map, in a red-shaded area northeast of the Packard 
               Sawmill on Black Lake we see the words: "PROPOSED SITE FOR

               Benjamin Home stands at the head of a table, addressing the 
               fifteen Norwegian businessmen. Beside him, an INTERPRETER 
               translates each sentence into Norwegian. Leland Palmer sits 
               at Horne's right hand.

                                     HORNE
                              (in the middle of his 
                              spiel)

                         was naturally concerned about the 
                         air here... if you'll permit me to 
                         repeat what you told me after your

                         "My air sacs never felt so good!"

               After the translation, the group all nod good-naturedly and 
               SVEN turns red. During which a HOTEL EMPLOYEE enters and 
               discreetly whispers something to Leland Palmer. Palmer nods 
               and rises.

                                     LELAND
                         Excuse me a moment, gentleman.

                         So you see, here in Twin Peaks, 
                         industry and health go hand in hand...

               Palmer exits.

                                     SARAH
                         Honey, it's Sarah, is Laura with 
                         you?

                              (slightly hysterical)
                         She didn't go with you this morning?

                         No, what's wrong, what's this about?

                         She's not here, she wasn't here this 
                         morning--

               Looking out the window, Leland sees Sheriff Steadman drive 
               up, park and walk towards the hotel.

                                     LELAND
                         She's probably with Bobby--

                         I can't find him--

                         Well that's it then, let's not worry--

                                     SARAH
                         She would've left a note, why didn't 
                         she tell me? Why didn't she leave me 
                         a note?

                                     LELAND
                         Sarah, calm down, darling, please...

               Looking out towards the lobby he sees Steadman, speaking to 
               the DESK CLERK, who points in to where Leland is on the phone. 
               The Sheriff sees Leland, locks eyes with him and starts 
               walking towards him.

                              (the first hint of 
                              alarm, to himself)
                         Sheriff Steadman...

                                     SARAH
                              (panicking)
                         Who? What did you say?

                                     LELAND
                              (trying to cover)
                         Please. Sarah. I'm going to have to 
                         call you back.

                                     SARAH
                              (seeing it all, coming 
                              unglued)
                         Oh my God... oh my God, Laura, no, 
                         Laura!

                         Sarah...

               The Sheriff reaches Leland, hat in hand. Leland covers the 
               mouthpiece of the phone.

                                     STEADMAN
                         Mr. Palmer...

                         Is this about Laura?

                                     STEADMAN
                         I'm afraid it is, sir.

               We hear Sarah screaming for Leland over the phone.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Leland, what is it? My baby! Tell 
                         me, oh God, Leland!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               LELAND

               Having heard the news, he goes back to the phone.

                                     LELAND
                              (trembling, trying to 
                              stay calm)
                         Sarah, I'm on my way home... please, 
                         Sarah.

               He hangs up. Picks up and struggling to remember the number, 
               unsteadily punches it in.

                                     LELAND
                         Janice, this is Leland, oh God...
                              (he's momentarily 
                              overcome, then)
                         ...I want you to go next door and 
                         stay with Sarah until I get there--
                         please just do it.

               He hangs up.

                                     STEADMAN
                         Let me drive you, sir.

               Palmer nods, points vaguely back towards the meeting room.

                                     LELAND
                         I, uh, should tell Mr. Horne and 
                         the...

                         I'm sure they'll understand.

               Benjamin Horne appears in the doorway.

                                     HORNE
                         Leland, we're ready to go over the 
                         contracts...
                              (sees him)

                         My daughter's dead.

               EXT. PALMER HOUSE - MORNING

               JANICE HOGAN, the Palmer's next door neighbor, exits the 
               front door of her house and runs next door to the Palmers' 
               house. She knocks on the door. We hear a heart-rending wail 
               of grief from inside.

                                     JANICE
                         Sarah?!

               She opens she door and rushes inside. Pause.  Another cry.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Re-establish. A Volkswagen beetle pulls up and a UNIFORMED 
               WAITRESS gets out and goes inside.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DOUBLE "R" DINER - MORNING

               SHELLY JOHNSON, a young, slim waitress, is putting on her 
               coat, as the other waitress, HEIDI, a hefty German girl, 
               enters. The owner of the diner, NORMA JENNINGS, a statuesque, 
               well-preserved forty year old former beauty queen, pours a 
               warm-up for BOBBY BRIGGS, handsome, muscular high school 
               senior, wearing a letter jacket.

                                     SHELLY
                              (popping gum)
                         What kept ya, Heidi? Seconds on 
                         knockwurst this morning?

               Heidi, a bubbly, easily embarrassed girl, giggles and blushes.

                                     HEIDI
                         I couldn't get my car started.

                                     SHELLY
                         Too busy jumpstartin' the old man.

                                     BOBBY
                         Thought you Germans were always on 
                         time.

                                     NORMA
                         Bobby, I thought the only time you 
                         cared about was makin' time.

               Bobby and Shelly exchange a slightly guilty look. Bobby rises, 
               puts some change on the counter.

                                     BOBBY
                         Hey, Shelly, you headin' out?

                                     SHELLY
                         Headin' home.

                                     BOBBY
                         I gotta go to practice, I could drop 
                         you at your place on the way.

                                     SHELLY
                         That'd be great, thanks.

                                     BOBBY
                              (as they go, holds up 
                              a quarter)
                         Here's a tune for you gals. Norma, 
                         I'll see you in my dreams.

                                     NORMA
                         Not if I see you first.

                                     BOBBY
                         Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

               He drops the quarter in a jukebox, punches a song in. Bobby 
               and Shelly exit the diner as an aggressively cheerful German 
               Polka blares from the jukebox.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Bobby opens the door of his souped-up Buick Electra '88 
               convertible for Shelly.

                                     BOBBY
                              (under his breath)
                         I think she knows about us.

                                     SHELLY
                         Norma? Fat chance. She's probably 
                         hot to trot for you herself.

               She gets in.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BOBBY'S CAR - MORNING

               Bobby climbs in behind the wheel and starts the car. They 
               look around for a moment, make sure no one is watching them, 
               then kiss hotly.

                                     SHELLY
                         I was thinkin' about you.

                                     BOBBY
                         Yeah?

                                     SHELLY
                         All night.
                              (she caresses him 
                              intimately)

                                     BOBBY
                         All right.

               He steps on it and peels out of the parking lot.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. LUCKY HIGHWAY "21" - MORNING

               As they drive down the highway, a Sheriff's cruiser, lights 
               and siren blaring, approaches them, headed the other way.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Shelly and Bobby watch the cruiser as it zooms by them, then 
               look back. She takes a pull off a silver flask and knocks it 
               back. Bobby looks at her.

                                     SHELLY
                         Hey, it's happy hour in France.
                              (offers it to Bobby)
                         Come on. Breakfast of champions.

                                     BOBBY
                         Right. 'Little pick-me-up before

                         Thought I was your little pick-me-
                         up.

                                     BOBBY
                         Baby, you're more like a three-stage 
                         rocket. A pocket rocket.

                                     SHELLY
                         What stage are we in now?

                                     BOBBY
                         You sure your old man's still on the 
                         road?

                                     SHELLY
                         Called me last night from Tacoma. 
                         Talked dirty to me for an hour. And 
                         he ain't got a phone in his truck.
                              (a highly suggestive 
                              look)
                         Quit worryin' and start scurryin', 
                         Mr. Touchdown.

               Bobby steps on it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               At the base of Sparkwood Mountain. Bobby drives around a 
               corner and starts up a steep driveway leading to Shelly's 
               house. They drive around another corner and Bobby slams on 
               the brakes when they see the cab of a large semi rig parked 
               in the driveway in front of the house.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         He's home. Damn. Damn it.
                              (bangs her head back 
                              against the headrest)

               Bobby throws it into reverse and backs up behind a stand of 
               trees.

                                     SHELLY
                         Damn it. Call you later.

               Shelly jumps out of the car. Bobby backs down the driveway 
               at thirty miles an hour.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Sheriff Steadman drives his cruiser into the driveway and 
               Leland Palmer steps out on the passenger's car. Mrs. Palmer 
               comes frantically out of the house and down the steps. He 
               stops. She moves close to him, sees the grief in his eyes, 
               then runs to him, screaming, hitting him, sobbing 
               hysterically. He struggles to hold onto her until she 
               collapses in his arms.

               EXT. CALHOUN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - MORNING

               A '30's Federal-style structure on the edge of the old 
               downtown. The Coroner's station wagon is parked outside an 
               entrance to the basement.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MORGUE CORRIDOR - MORNING

               Dr. Hayward is seated in the corridor. He rises as Leland 
               Palmer and Sheriff Steadman come around the corner.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Leland, I'm so sorry.

                                     LELAND
                         Seventeen years old.

               Hayward puts his arms around his old friend. They embrace. 
               Palmer pulls away. Looks at the door marked "CORONER." Steels 
               himself for what's coming.

                                     STEADMAN
                         Hate to put you through this.

                                     LELAND
                         No. I have to see her. I want to see 
                         what was done to my little girl.

               Steadman leads him through the door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MORGUE - MORNING

               Leland watches as a MORGUE ATTENDANT slides open a 
               refrigerated vault holding the body of Laura Palmer. The 
               Attendant removes the sheet. Palmer inhales sharply. His 
               face crumbles. He reaches out blindly, puts a hand on 
               Steadman's shoulder. Steadman holds him up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. TWIN PEAKS FIELDHOUSE - MORNING

               Bobby slows down to cruising speed, pulls up alongside a 
               group of Twin Peaks High School football players, jogging on 
               the other side of a chainlink fence.

                                     BOBBY
                         Hey, suckers.

               MIKE NELSON, one of the players peels off from the group and 
               slows to speak to him.

                                     MIKE
                         Hey, man, you better get your butt 
                         over to school, something's up.

                                     BOBBY
                         That's what she said.

                                     MIKE
                         You think I'm kidding.

                                     BOBBY
                         What, me worry?

               Bobby smiles, taps the accelerator and drives off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. TWIN PEAKS HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING

               Bobby tools into the school parking lot. Gets out. Notices a 
               Sheriff's department cruiser parked outside, lights flashing.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HIGH SCHOOL MAIN HALL - MORNING

               Bobby enters the building, passes a cluster of kids standing 
               outside the office. Bobby notices the kids staring at him 
               and stares aggressively back.

                                     GIRL WITH GLASSES
                         Bobby Briggs, they're looking for 
                         you.

                                     BOBBY
                         Who is?

                                     ANOTHER KID
                         Sheriff is.

                                     BOBBY
                         Well here I am in school.

               MRS. JACKSON, the Principal's secretary, standing inside the 
               school office, sees Bobby in the hallway through the glass 
               partition. She steps outside to speak to him.

                                     MRS. JACKSON
                         Bobby, you're wanted in the 
                         principal's office.

                                     BOBBY
                         Who wants me in the principal's 
                         office?

                                     MRS. JACKSON
                         Right now, young man.

               Bobby throws a swaggering look back at the group of kids and 
               saunters into the office.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

               Senior Home Room class. MARGARET HONEYCUTT, the teacher, is 
               calling the roll.

                                     HONEYCUTT
                         ...Terry Franklin...

               The kids raises their hands as she calls their names.

                                     HONEYCUTT
                         ...Martha Grimes... Donna Hayward...

               A very smart and very pretty girl, DONNA HAYWARD, daughter 
               of Dr. Hayward, looks up and responds.

                                     DONNA
                         Here.

               Looking out the door window, Donna notices two State Troopers 
               walking up to the door.

                                     HONEYCUTT
                         ...Audrey Horne...

               Benjamin Horne's daughter, AUDREY HORNE, a delicate, 
               Botticelli-like beauty, with a halo of wavy black hair and 
               dark, haunted eyes, raises her hand.

                                     HONEYCUTT
                         ...James Hurley...

               JAMES HURLEY, a handsome, clean-cut young man with intelligent 
               eyes, in a black leather jacket, seated in the back corner, 
               his motorcycle boots up on the back of the chair in front of 
               him.

                                     JAMES
                         Yo.

               One of the State Troopers enters the classroom and signals 
               Honeycutt. The other Trooper remains standing outside the 
               door.

                                     TROOPER #1
                         Excuse me, m'am, is Bobby Briggs in 
                         this class?

                                     HONEYCUTT
                         No, he's in 107.

                                     TROOPER #1
                         Could I speak to you for a moment, 
                         please?

                                     HONEYCUTT
                         Certainly.

               Honeycutt moves over to the Trooper. He speaks quietly to 
               her. The class watches closely.

               A GIRL runs by outside the window, in the interior grass 
               courtyard, crying hysterically.

               A buzz of curiosity builds through the classroom. Mrs. 
               Honeycutt turns and looks towards the seat next to Donna. 
               The one empty seat in the room.

               Donna notices Honeycutt's look. Donna looks at her arms. 
               Covered with goosebumps. Without knowing why, her eyes tear 
               up. Donna turns to look at James. He's staring right at her, 
               sharing the same sudden fear.

               The Second Trooper sticks his head back into the classroom.

                                     TROOPER #2
                         We got him.

               The First Trooper hurries out and they move off down the 
               hall towards the office. Honeycutt turns to the class, her 
               face a mask of unsettled emotions.

                                     HONEYCUTT
                              (voice trembling)
                         There'll be an announcement from the 
                         Principal's office...

               She can't continue, her lip quivering violently. One more 
               word and she'll dissolve in tears. She goes to her desk and 
               sits and stares off into the comer.

                                     DONNA
                              (silently, to herself)
                         Laura...

               A pencil snaps in James' hand.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - MORNING

               The told State Troopers enter the office. Bobby is seated in 
               the middle of the room. Surrounded by Deputy Andy Brennan, a 
               second deputy, a black man, BERNIE HILL, and the School 
               Principal, GEORGE WOLCHEZK, a stolid, pale, balding man, mid-
               fifties.

                                     BOBBY
                              (frightened)
                         --I told you, I got up early like I 
                         always do, I went running like I 
                         always do, I went to breakfast at 
                         the Double "R" and I didn't go to 
                         practice 'cause I didn't feel like 
                         it.

                                     BERNIE
                         Why didn't you feel like it, Bobby? 
                         Were you upset about something?

                                     ANDY
                         Something troubling you, Bobby? You 
                         want to tell us about it?

                                     BOBBY
                         Look, you guys, please, what'd I to? 
                         What's goin' on?

               The door opens. Sheriff Steadman enters. Red-eyed, Mrs. 
               Jackson, Wolchezk's secretary, leans in behind him to say...

                                     MRS. JACKSON
                         Mr. Wolchezk, there's rumors all 
                         over school. Maybe it'd be best if 
                         they heard it from you.

               Wolchezk nods. Steadman indicates to him "just a moment".

                                     BOBBY
                         What is it? What's going on? Sheriff?

                                     STEADMAN
                         Now, Bobby, look at me. Your 
                         girlfriend, Laura Palmer's been 
                         killed. She was found just after 
                         dawn. She was with you last night 
                         and you weren't where you were 
                         supposed to be this morning. Have 
                         these fellas advised you of your 
                         rights?

                                     BOBBY
                         Yes, but I didn't know why--Laura's 
                         dead?

                                     STEADMAN
                         Yes. Did you understand your rights 
                         as they were explained to you?

                                     BOBBY
                         Yeah, Jesus, you think I killed her?

                                     STEADMAN
                              (firmly)
                         Bobby, we're gonna have you make a 
                         phone call, you can call your folks 
                         and they can arrange to get a lawyer 
                         to be with you when we talk some 
                         more--Andy, take Bobby out to make 
                         his call--

                                     BOBBY
                         I loved her! And she loves me!

               Pause. Andy takes Bobby by the arm. Bobby shakes him off.

                                     BOBBY
                         You think 'cause I wasn't at football 
                         practice that I killed my girlfriend? 
                         You guys are nuts!

                                     STEADMAN
                              (no more arguments)
                         Bobby... we're gonna talk about this 
                         later. Mr. Wolchezk, why don't you 
                         go ahead and make that announcement?

               Andy leads Bobby out of the room. Wolchezk nods. Goes to the 
               public address system microphone behind his desk. Picks up 
               the microphone. Flips on the system. Collects himself.

                                     WOLCHEZK
                         May I have your attention please... 
                         may I have your attention... this is 
                         Principal Wolchezk...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDOR - MORNING

               We slowly drift down the corridor away from the office. Bobby 
               is visible in the office, through the glass partitions, making 
               his phone call. The sound of the announcement fades in and 
               out, echoing through the empty halls as we pass different 
               class rooms.

                              (over)
                         ...I am deeply saddened to have to 
                         tell you that early this morning 
                         your classmate Laura Palmer was found 
                         dead...

               We hear shrieks and cries of grief from the various 
               classrooms.

                         ...this is a terrible moment for all 
                         of us, for all of us who knew her, 
                         her friends and family and it is 
                         important that we all try to help 
                         each other through this difficult 
                         time... the police have asked me to 
                         ask all of you, if you have any 
                         information concerning Laura's 
                         activities after school yesterday, 
                         or yesterday evening to please come 
                         forward... I am hereby suspending 
                         all classes for the day but before 
                         we leave I would like to ask all of 
                         you to join me in observing a moment 
                         of silence...
                              (his voice breaking)
                         ...for Laura and her dear memory...

               We come to rest on a trophy case in the hallway. Prominent 
               among the trophies is a large photo of Laura, wearing a crown 
               and gown, with Bobby in background, and bearing the caption:

                          HOMECOMING QUEEN, 1988, LAURA PALMER.

               We stay on the photo throughout the moment of silence.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DONNA HAYWARD

               In her classroom, raising her head up after the moment of 
               silence, tears streaming down her face. Another GIRL puts 
               her arms around Donna's shoulders, comforting her. Tears and 
               cries of disbelief from throughout the classroom. Donna looks 
               back at...

               Two sheriff's department cruisers and a state trooper's car 
               are parked outside. One of the Troopers we saw at the high 
               school is talking on his radio. a small group of NEIGHBORS 
               have gathered at a discreet distance, watching the house, 
               talking with quiet concern among themselves.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PALMER HOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Sarah Palmer reclines on a Barca-lounger, a cold compress on 
               her forehead. His bag open beside him, Dr. Hayward has just 
               administered an injection to Sarah, discarding the syringe 
               and rolling her sleeve back down her arm. Janice brings Sarah 
               a glass of water.

               Andy Brennan stands at the foot of the stairs. Sheriff 
               Steadman is seated on an ottoman next to Sarah, quietly 
               questioning her.

                                     STEADMAN
                         What time was it when you last saw 
                         Laura, Mrs. Palmer?

                                     SARAH
                              (the sedative taking 
                              effect)
                         What time? Uh, I suppose, let me 
                         see... it would have been about nine 
                         I think, yes, nine o'clock. She came 
                         back from Bobby's and was going up 
                         those stairs, those stairs right 
                         there.

                                     STEADMAN
                         Did she say anything?

                                     SARAH
                              (dreamy)
                         No. She said goodnight. And I said, 
                         "Goodnight, sweetheart" Then I heard 
                         her door close.

               She's close to tears for a moment, then it passes. Hayward 
               takes her hand and holds it. Sarah hears footsteps upstairs.

                                     SARAH
                         Who's upstairs now?

                                     STEADMAN
                         Your husband and one of my men.

                                     SARAH
                         I can tell from the sounds that it 
                         isn't her...

               Steadman and Hayward exchange a look.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAURA'S BEDROOM - DAY

               Leland Palmer sits on the unmade bed, his hand absent-mindedly 
               brushing the bedspread. Deputy Bernie Hill is unobtrusively 
               searching the room. He opens a dresser drawer beside the bed 
               and discovers a locked diary, embosses with Laura's initials.

                                     BERNIE
                         Do you know where the key for this 
                         is, sir?

                                     LELAND
                              (shakes his head)
                         Do you have to take that?

                                     BERNIE
                         We'll return it as soon as possible.

               Palmer nods. Bernie places the diary in a cardboard box along 
               with other collected evidence; her schoolbooks, letters, 
               etc.

               Bernie moves to and opens the closet door. Turns on an 
               overhead light. The first thing he sees is a video camera 
               sitting on a shelf.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PALMER LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Steadman continues to gently question Sarah.

                                     STEADMAN
                         Can you remember, Mrs. Palmer... did 
                         she make or receive any phone calls?

                                     SARAH
                         I heard her phone ring once.

                                     STEADMAN
                         About what time was that?

                                     SARAH
                         I don't know who it was...

               The phone rings. Steadman looks at Andy, who goes into the 
               kitchen to answer it.

                                     STEADMAN
                         Do you recall the time?

                                     SARAH
                         I was combing my hair...

                                     STEADMAN
                         You were getting ready for bed.

                                     SARAH
                         Yes. Leland was just coming home...

               She fades. Steadman realizes the interrogation is effectively 
               coming to an end. The doorbell rings. Janice moves to the 
               door, opens it and admits FATHER CLARENCE HUTCHINSON, a 
               rumpled, white-haired Episcopalian minister.

                                     JANICE
                         Father...

                                     FATHER CLARENCE
                              (nods, quietly)
                         How is she?

               Janice takes his hat and coat.

                                     JANICE
                         She's been asking for you.

               Clarence moves into the living room Steadman rises.

                                     FATHER CLARENCE
                              (nodding to the other 
                              men)
                         Sarah?

               Sarah looks up at him. Blinks. He takes her hand, sits beside 
               her.

                                     SARAH
                         There's no more pain now, is there?

                                     CLARENCE
                              (gently, soothing)
                         Our thoughts and prayers guide her 
                         to her rest. And she is at peace, 
                         Sarah. The peace of the just and the 
                         good.

               Sarah sits back, finding some comfort in his words. Returning 
               from the kitchen, Andy signals Steadman over to him.

                                     ANDY
                              (quietly urgent)
                         That was Lucy. Got a call from a guy 
                         works up at the mill, Janek Pulaski. 
                         Says his daughter didn't come home 
                         last night. And she didn't show up 
                         at school today either.

               Off Steadman's concern...

               A State Trooper rapidly walks JANEK PULASKI, a barrel-shaped 
               mill worker, past the powerful, ripping saws towards the 
               exit. Pulaski's eyes are red from tears and stress.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               embarrassed Pete Martell stands by, near a large, control 
               console.

                                     KATHERINE
                         You're not going anywhere and you're 
                         not telling anybody anything!

                         Katherine, I am sorry if this offends 
                         you, but I am the owner of this

                         And you don't know the first thing 
                         about this sawmill, that's why I'm 
                         running it--

                         I haven't exercised this authority 
                         before but maybe I should have--

                                     KATHERINE
                         You're not shutting us down!

                                     GIOVANNA

                              firmness)
                         No! I have the final say-so. Pete, 
                         push the plug!

                         Pete, don't you dare!

               Pete considers for a moment, then pushes some large buttons 
               and throws some switches. Katherine storms off.

                                                                  INTERCUT:

               THROUGHOUT THE MILL

               The faces of the WORKERS are turned up towards the office 
               and the speakers.

                                     GIOVANNA
                         This morning, as you know, the body 
                         of Miss Laura Palmer was found near 
                         our dock. Just now your friend and 
                         co-worker Mr. Janek Pulaski has 
                         learned that his daughter Sharon, 
                         one of Laura's schoolmates, is missing 
                         since last night... I suffered the 
                         loss of someone dear to me not long 
                         ago and when my husband, Andrew, 
                         died the kind words and feelings 
                         that you expressed to me helped me 
                         so much. You are very kind people. I 
                         have decided that today, in the lights 
                         of what has happened, all work here 
                         will stop, the Mill will shut down. 
                         Perhaps you will spend the day with 
                         your families and once again you can 
                         all extend your good wishes to the 
                         Pulaskis and to the Palmers.
                              (pause)
                         Thank you all for your attention.

               Silence throughout the mill.

               KATHERINE

               In a hallway, listening to Giovanna on one of the loud 
               speakers.

                                     KATHERINE
                              (to the speaker)
                         Bitch!

               She turns and sees startled MILL WORKER standing behind her, 
               hat in hand.

                                     KATHERINE
                         What's you name?

                                     WORKER

                         You're fired!

               She storms off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. HIGHWAY "21" - DAY

               An empty road. Silence, suddenly broken by James Hurley, on 
               his motorcycle, cutting through the wind with reckless 
               abandon.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ED HURLEY'S GAS STATION - DAY

               James drives the bike off the highway, into the station and 
               pulls up next to the pumps. Without a glance at the office, 
               he screws off the cap and starts filling the bike's gas tank.

               ED HURLEY, James' uncle, a thin, taciturn man of forty, steps 
               out of the office and walks out to James as he tops off his 
               tank and hangs up the nozzle. Mindful of his state, Ed waits 
               for James to speak.

                                     JAMES
                         Laura's dead.

                                     ED
                         I heard.

               With restrained emotion, Ed puts a hand on James' shoulder. 
               James inhales deeply, choking back his feelings. Looks at 
               his Uncle. Looks away.

                                     JAMES
                         She was the one.

                                     ED
                              (nods, waits)
                         Buy you a cup a coffee?

               Pause.

                                     JAMES
                         'Can't do it.

               Before he's overcome with pain, James takes out a folded 
               note, hands it to Ed.

                                     JAMES
                         If Donna comes by, would you give 
                         this to her?

                                     ED
                         You bet.

               James hops on the bike, kicks it to life and roars off. Ed 
               watches him go. The door to the office opens and Ed's wife, 
               NADINE, a small, angry woman, wearing a black patch over her 
               left eye, calls out at him.

                                     NADINE
                         Ed? They said those drapes'd be ready 
                         by ten; now I want those drapes up 
                         by nightfall.

               Ed exhales heavily, waves at her without looking at her and 
               heads for his pick-up, parked nearby.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. REMOTE MOUNTAINOUS TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - DAY

               A eighteen-wheel logging truck with a full load barrels along, 
               downshifting to brake its speed on the steep decline.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. WOODS - DAY

               A rustling in a dark thicket. Bloodied bare feet stumbling 
               aimlessly town a slope.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LOGGING TRUCK CAB - DAY

               As the DRIVER muscles his cab around a horseshoe bend, he 
               sees someone step out onto the road a few hundred feet ahead. 
               The Driver steps on the brakes and downshifts frantically. 
               The engine whines in protest.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE WHEELS

               Of the big rig screech along the blacktop, burning and 
               smoking.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE DRIVER'S POV

               Through the windshield, as the truck closes rapidly on the 
               missing high school girl, SHARON PULASKI, standing in the 
               middle of the road, dazed, helpless, bruised and cut, wearing 
               only bra and panties.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE TRUCK

               Finally lurches to a halt only a few inches from Sharon. Her 
               lost, brutalized face opens into a silent scream.

                                                              CUT TO BLACK:

               INT. HOSPITAL INTENSIVE CARE - DAY

               Sharon Pulaski lies in a hospital bed, attached by various 
               tubes to life-support machines and monitors. A Nurse fluffs 
               a pillow under her head, as another fits an oxygen tube to 
               her nostril.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               GROUP OF TRACKING DOGS

               Barking, restless, anxious to follow a scent. They're on the 
               highway, where Sharon came out of the woods. The logging 
               truck is pulled off the road, the Driver is talking to Andy 
               Brennan, who's filling out a report.

               Deputy Bernie Hill drives up in a cruiser, exits, carrying a 
               plastic evidence bag containing the clothes Sharon was 
               wearing. He takes them over to the dog's HANDLERS. The 
               Handlers open the bag and give the dog's the scent.

               A number of Deputies and CIVILIAN VOLUNTEERS follow the dogs, 
               as they pick up the trail and strain at their leashes, 
               bounding up the hill into the woods.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               A nondescript, government-issue, tan sedan drives up towards 
               Twin Peaks. Passes a sign that reads:

                        "WELCOME TO TWIN PEAKS. POPULATION 51,201"

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Behind the wheel is FBI field agent DALE COOPER, mid-thirties, 
               handsome in an unremarkable way. He activates and speaks 
               into a microphone attached to his lapel, connected to a small, 
               Walkman-sized tape recorder clipped to his belt.

                         14. Entering town of Twin Peaks. 
                         Five miles south of the Canadian 
                         border, twelve miles west of the 
                         state line. Never seen so many trees 
                         in my life. As W.C. Fields would 
                         say, I'd rather be here than 
                         Philadelphia. It's 54 degrees on a 
                         beautiful sunny afternoon. Weatherman 
                         said rain. If you could get paid 
                         that kind of money for being wrong 
                         60% of the time it'd beat working. 
                         Mileage is 79,345, gauge is on 
                         reserve, I'm riding on fumes, have 
                         to tank up when I get into town, 
                         remind me to tell you how much that 
                         is. Lunch was $6.31 and I left her a 
                         dollar tip, at the...

                         2 near Lewis Fork. That was a tuna 
                         fish sandwich on whole wheat and a 
                         slice of cherry pie and coffee. Darn 
                         good food. And if you ever get up 
                         this way, Diane, that cherry pie is 
                         worth a stop. Okay.
                              (looks for his notes)
                         I'll be looking for a...
                              (reads)
                         ...Sheriff Daniel Steadman, he's 
                         going to be at the Calhoun Memorial 
                         Hospital with that girl they pulled 
                         off the mountain. I'll be checking 
                         into a motel after we're through 
                         there. Sure the Sheriff'll be able 
                         to recommend a clean place. Reasonably 
                         priced.

                         Forgot to mention. I stopped for 
                         coffee and a pit stop about 10:30, 
                         little diner near Bitteroot Lake. 
                         Excellent coffee. Forgot to get the 
                         receipt, can you believe it? That 
                         was seventy five cents and I left a 
                         quarter on the counter. Got to find 
                         out what kind of trees these are. 
                         They're really something.

               Turns off the microphone. Whistles "Rhapsody in Blue."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CALHOUN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - DAY

               In long shot, we see Dale Cooper drive up, get out of the 
               car where he's greeted by Sheriff Steadman and together they 
               enter the hospital.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

               Steadman and Cooper walk down the corridor.

                                     STEADMAN
                         Sure glad to have you here. Kind'a 
                         lucky, in a way, Sharon stepped out 
                         across the state line. Whole town's 
                         really badly shaken up--

                                     COOPER
                         Sure it is, nice, quiet place, 
                         something like this. Let me stop you 
                         right here in the hallway for second, 
                         Sheriff.

                              factly)
                         There a few things we ought to get 
                         straight right off the bat. I've 
                         learned this the hard way and it's 
                         better to talk it out up front. When 
                         the Bureau gets called in, the 
                         Bureau's in charge. You're going to

                         law enforcement has a problem with 
                         that. Hope you understand.

                         have you got growing all around the

                         report on the dead girl while we're 
                         in with the witness?

                                     STEADMAN
                         'Haven't done the autopsy yet. We 
                         can go downstairs to the morgue when 
                         we're done here.

                         Fine. What've we got from Sharon so 
                         far?

                                     STEADMAN
                         She hasn't said word one since we 
                         found her.

               INT. INTENSIVE CARE - DAY

               Sharon Pulaski lies in bed, an IV in her arm, hooked up to 
               monitors, attended by two NURSES. Steadman and Cooper enter. 
               Seeing them, the attending physician, an attractive woman, 
               DR. SHELVY, moves towards them from the bed.

                                     STEADMAN
                         Dr. Shelvy, this is FBI Agent Dale 
                         Cooper.

                                     SHELVY
                         Glad to know you.

                                     COOPER
                         Doctor. How's the girl?

                                     SHELVY
                         She's in shock. Suffering from 
                         exposure.

                                     COOPER
                         Was she raped?

                                     SHELVY
                         Yes. More than once.

                                     COOPER
                         One perpetrator?

                                     SHELVY
                         Waiting for the tests.

                                     COOPER
                              (to Steadman)
                         Any connection to the murdered girl?

                                     STEADMAN
                         Same high school. Far as we know 
                         they hardly knew each other.
                              (shrugs)
                         No connection.

                                     COOPER
                         Can I question her?

                                     SHELVY
                         This girl doesn't even know where 
                         she is. Or if she is.

                                     COOPER
                         What are you saying?

                                     SHELVY
                         We need a CAT scan and we aren't 
                         equipped for that. My opinion is 
                         there may be neurological damage. 
                         She's just not responsive at all.

                                     COOPER
                         I'd like to look at her fingers.

               Shelvy and Steadman look at each other.

                                     SHELVY
                         All right.

               Cooper moves to Sharon. Her eyes are open, looking up at the 
               ceiling, moving restlessly. Cooper picks up left hand, looks 
               closely at the wrists, sees the distinctive wounds and a 
               look of intense interest comes over him. He immediately looks 
               very closely at her fingernails.

                                     STEADMAN
                         We already scraped for particles.

                                     COOPER
                         That's not what I'm looking for.
                              (looks closely, almost 
                              to himself)
                         Nothing here... not a thing...

                              (a sort of drugged, 
                              horrified whine)
                         Don't go there...

                                     SHELVY
                              (moving quickly to 
                              her side)
                         Sharon?

                                     COOPER
                         Sharon?

               Sharon almost seems to focus on them for a moment. A single 
               tear runs from her eye.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

               We see the floor indicator numbers light up, going down as 
               the elevator descends. Steadman and Cooper ride down, along 
               with a ONE-ARMED MAN. The door opens on the first floor. We 
               notice a MAN talking to a NURSE, seated behind a desk, eating 
               her lunch off a cafeteria tray. She laughs uneasily at 
               something the Man says. The One-Armed Man exits. The elevator 
               doors close.

               The elevator descends to the basement. The doors open. 
               Steadman and Cooper exit.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MORGUE EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY

               Bright overhead lights pop on, momentarily blinding us. A 
               low, vibratory throb of humming machinery. Steadman and Cooper 
               and a MORGUE ATTENDANT walk to a stainless steel examination 
               table in the middle of the white-tiled room.

               Laura Palmer's body lies on the table, covered by a shroud 
               of cloudy plastic. Cooper takes her left arm out from under 
               the cover and examines her fingers.

                                     STEADMAN
                         We did scrape the nails when she 
                         came in.

                                     COOPER
                              (sees something under 
                              the nail of her ring 
                              finger; energized)
                         There it is. Here it is. Oh my God, 
                         there it is.

                                     STEADMAN
                         What?

                                     COOPER
                              (to the Morgue 
                              Attendant)
                         Leave us alone please.

               The Attendant looks at Steadman. He nods. The Attendant exits.

                                     COOPER
                              (pointing to her nail)
                         Sheriff, I need something to grab 
                         onto this.

               Steadman uncovers and rummages through an autopsy tool tray, 
               finds and hands Cooper a pair of fine tweezers. Cooper 
               separates the nail from the finger, works the tweezers in 
               and dislodges a small, white speck from under the nail onto 
               a stainless steel tray.

               Cooper turns on his microphone, swings a mounted magnifying 
               glass over the tray, pulls it down over the speck and turns 
               on its attached light.

                         Morgue. With the body of the victim... 
                         what's her name?

                         Laura Palmer. Got here before the 
                         autopsy. It's the same thing, Diane, 
                         told you I had a feeling we'd see 
                         this again

                                     STEADMAN
                         What've you got there?

                                     COOPER
                         Ring finger. Under the nail. Let's 
                         see what he left us.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS

               Using the tweezers, Cooper turns over the speck and we see 
               printed on the tiny piece of white paper is the letter "R" .

                                     COOPER
                         It's an "r". Diane, let's give this 
                         to Albert and his team, don't go to 
                         Sam, Albert seems to have a little 
                         more on the ball.

                         about.

               Donna Hayward drives up in a Mercedes-Benz station wagon and 
               parks behind the Roadhouse Nightclub, near a couple of 
               motorcycles, in front of a large, wooden shed. On the roof 
               of the shed is an erector-set-like oil derrick-shaped 
               structure, supporting a small, blue neon sign that reads:

                                      "HEMINGWAY'S"

               Donna goes up the steps to the door, knocks and enters.

               A sparsely furnished coffee house. Two walls with shelves 
               packed with books. On the wall behind a small raised platform 
               is a large, black and white photograph of Ernest Hemingway. 
               Two BIKERS in black leather sit at one of the tables, reading 
               books. JAKE MORISSEY, the large, friendly owner of the 
               Roadhouse and "Hemingway's", wearing an apron, is cleaning 
               an unique brass Espresso machine.

               THE BED OF THE PICK-UP

               Inside is a large, wrapped package with a label that reads, 
               "GENTLE JIM'S DRAPES." Ed turns from the truck bed, as he 
               sees Donna get out of her car and approach him.

                                     DONNA
                         Hi, Ed.

                                     ED
                         Hey, Donna.

               He sees she's about to burst into tears, opens his arms and 
               embraces her. She weeps.

                                     ED
                         I'm so sorry...

               She nods, starts to regain her composure.

                                     DONNA
                         Have you seen James?

                                     ED
                         He came by.

                                     DONNA
                         Is he okay?

                                     ED
                         No.

                                     DONNA
                         You know where he went? He wasn't up 
                         at "Hemingway's."

                                     ED
                         I don't know. But he said to to give 
                         this to you.

               He hands her a folded note. Donna opens it. It reads:

                           "21 BILLIARDS. SEE JOEY AFTER NINE."

               Out on the highway, a white 1959 Chevy Impala slams on its 
               brakes, hits the horn, the driver does a squealing U-turn to 
               pull into the gas station parking lot and stops near Donna 
               and Ed. Mike Nelson, Bobby's friend, is driving the car. He 
               leans out the window.

                                     MIKE
                              (furious; to Donna)
                         Hey! What the hell are you doin' 
                         here?

                                     DONNA
                         I--

                                     MIKE
                         We've been lookin' all over for you! 
                         In case you didn't know it, Bobby's 
                         in a lot of trouble! He's my best 
                         friend, you're supposed to be with 
                         me and we're goin' down to the police 
                         station to be with him!

                                     DONNA
                         Don't tell me where I ought'a be--
                         and by the way, Laura was my best 
                         friend--

                                     MIKE
                         Get in the car!

                                     ED
                              (he's heard enough)
                         Muffle it there, Junior.

                                     MIKE
                         Mind your own business!

                                     ED
                         You're on my lot, friend.

                                     MIKE
                         Not for long! Donna, you get to the 
                         Sheriff's right now!

               Mike guns it and digs out in the loose gravel, fishtailing 
               onto the highway. Donna's trembling with anger and 
               frustration.

                                     DONNA
                         Boy, do I know how to pick 'em.

               Nadine throws open a window in their apartment above the 
               garage and calls out.

                                     NADINE
                         Ed! You waitin' for those drapes to 
                         hang themselves?!

                              at her; to Donna)
                         I know how to pick 'em too.

               They both manage a small smile. Donna heads for her car.

                                     DONNA
                         If you see James, tell him I'm looking 
                         for him.

                                     ED
                         You bet. Take it easy now, Donna.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EVIDENCE ROOM - DAY

               Steadman and Dale Cooper are seated at a table, examining 
               the box of evidence that was taken from Laura Palmer's 
               bedroom. Steadman takes a video cassette out of the box.

                                     COOPER
                         That's the tape you found in the 
                         video camera in Laura's room.

                                     STEADMAN
                         Right.

                                     COOPER
                         At a certain point I'm going to want 
                         to show that to the boyfriend.

                                     STEADMAN
                         You say when.

               Cooper puts on a pair of thin, rubber gloves and looks into 
               the box of Laura's belongings.

                                     COOPER
                         Did you complete all your forensics?

                                     STEADMAN
                         Yes.

               Cooper picks up Laura's locked diary.

                                     COOPER
                         No key yet, huh?

                                     STEADMAN
                         Still looking.

               Cooper casually snaps open the lock, opens the diary and 
               uses an orange stick to turn to the last entries. He activates 
               his tape recorder.

                                     COOPER
                         Diane, I've just opened Laura Palmer's 
                         diary. This is the last entry, dated 
                         yesterday, November 13...
                              (reads)

                         mean I'll never grow up"... then 
                         she's written...

                         about meeting 'J' tonight." That's 
                         the last entry.
                              (to Steadman)
                         That's something to get started on.

                                     STEADMAN
                              (writing down the

               Cooper turns back a few pages and reads again.

               THE DIARY

               As Cooper continues to thumb back through the pages, he finds 
               a small key inside a small, slit glassine envelope, taped to 
               a page.

                                     COOPER
                              (instant recognition)
                         Diane. I just turned back eighteen 
                         days; it says here, "Day One." What 
                         we've got taped to the page here is 
                         a glassine envelope containing a 
                         white residue and what looks to be a 
                         key to a...
                              (thinks, places it)

                              envelope)
                         Sheriff, after you very carefully 
                         remove this key, we're going to run 
                         this envelope and my bet is it'll 
                         test positive for cocaine.

                                     STEADMAN
                              (indignantly)
                         That's impossible--

                                     COOPER
                         You ever been surprised before?

                                     STEADMAN
                         Mr. Cooper, you didn't know Laura 
                         Palmer--

                                     COOPER
                         Benefit of the doubt, innocent until 
                         proven guilty, but that's still 
                         cocaine in that envelope.

               Holds out the envelope. Steadman takes it.

                                     COOPER
                         Get started on a court order to open 
                         her deposit box and maybe we'll both 
                         find out a few things about Laura 
                         Palmer.

               Steadman exits. Cooper reaches into the box again.

                                     COOPER
                         Diane, I'm holding in my hand a box 
                         of small, chocolate bunnies...

               A despondent Bobby Briggs sits at a table with his parents, 
               Bette and Major Briggs. Across from them is Bobby's lawyer, 
               a short, rotund, silver-throated man by the name of GILMAN 
               WHITE. A DEPUTY enters to announce...

                         We're ready for you.

               He waits to escort them out.

                                     GILMAN
                              (instructing Bobby)
                         Now Bobby, remember what I told you; 
                         the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
                         does not appreciate smart talk. You 
                         answer their questions, openly and 
                         honesty. If you're having any trouble, 
                         any strange feelings, any questions, 
                         you consult with me, that's why I'm 
                         here. If there are any questions I 
                         would prefer that you not answer 
                         directly, I will so signal you. Is 
                         that understood?

               Bobby nods sullenly.

                                     MAJOR BRIGGS
                         What do you say to Mr. White, Robert?

                         Yes, sir.

               The Deputy moves to Bobby. Bobby rises and walks out with 
               him. White picks up his briefcase and follows.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Steadman and Cooper enter and take seats across the table 
               from Bobby and Gilman White. There is a TV and VCR on a stand 
               in the corner.

                                     COOPER
                              (right to the point)
                         Bobby, did you kill Laura Palmer?

                                     BOBBY

                         that right?

                                     BOBBY
                         Yeah.
                              (looks at Gilman)
                         Yes, sir.

               Cooper shows Steadman the piece of paper: on it he's written, 
               "He didn't do it." Steadman is nonplusses.

                                     COOPER
                         She drive herself home?

                                     BOBBY
                         Yes.

                                     COOPER
                         You had a big fight with her last 
                         week, didn't you?

                                     BOBBY
                         So what?

               Gilman puts a hand on Bobby's arm.

                                     BOBBY
                         If I had a fight with her, if I sang 
                         songs with her, if I went skipping 
                         rope with her what difference does 
                         it make? I didn't kill her.

                                     COOPER
                         Bobby, here's how this works, we ask 
                         questions and you answer only the 
                         questions that we ask. Briefly and 
                         to the point.

               Cooper picks up a remote control and turns on the VCR in the 
               corner. A picture appears on the monitor.

                                                                  INTERCUT:

               THE MONITOR

               A slightly fuzzy picture: Donna and Laura in a sunlit forest 
               glade, having a Indian summer picnic on a red and white 
               checked blanket, blanket and mugging for the handheld video 
               camera. We don't see or hear the camera operator.

                                     COOPER
                              (watching Bobby 
                              carefully)
                         Did you shoot this video, Bobby?

               A cold, jealous rage rises in Bobby as he watches the girls 
               laughing, seeing only Laura and her happiness.

                                     BOBBY
                         No.

                                     COOPER
                         If you didn't take them, who did? 
                         Did you know that Laura was seeing 
                         someone else?
                              (no answer)
                         That's what you fought about last 
                         week, isn't it, Bobby? Look at these 
                         pictures, look how happy she is.
                              (no answer)
                         'You ever take cocaine with Laura?

                                     BOBBY
                              (shocked)
                         I never did that!

                                     GILMAN
                         Excuse me but what are you charging 
                         my client with?

                                     COOPER
                              (smiles, as he writes 
                              again)
                         That's right, you're a football 
                         player, aren't you, Bobby?

               He shows Steadman the pad; on it he's written: "Kid's a lousy 
               liar."

                                     COOPER
                         If you knew who she was seeing, trust 
                         me on this, now's the time to tell 
                         us.

                                     BOBBY
                         Why don't you ask Donna? She was 
                         there with 'em!

                                     COOPER
                         I'm asking you, Bobby. Give me a 
                         name. Here's a clue. First initial 
                         "J."

               Bobby can't, or won't, come up with a name.

                                     BOBBY
                              (almost to himself)
                         "J"...
                              (self-pitying)
                         She wouldn't. She wouldn't'a done 
                         that to me.
                              (almost mumbling)
                         I can't believe it. I can't believe 
                         it...

                                     COOPER
                              (as he rises)
                         You didn't love her anyway.
                              (to Steadman)
                         Let him go.

               Cooper exits. Steadman tries to give the appearance of keeping 
               up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Cooper exits the interrogation room. He looks towards the 
               desk and sees Donna speaking to Lucy, the dispatcher. Mike 
               is standing sullenly nearby. Cooper makes a bee-line for 
               Donna.

                                     COOPER
                         Donna?
                              (she looks up at him)
                         You and I are going to have a little 
                         talk about a picnic.

               Donna looks at Cooper, then at Mike.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MOUNTAIN SIDE FOREST - DAY

               A TRACKER is holding back two of his dogs, who are barking 
               furiously at the mouth of a hillside cave. A Trooper stands 
               by with his gun drawn.

               Deeply shaken, Deputy Andy Brennan exits the cave a moment 
               later, holding a flashlight and his gun. He absent-mindedly 
               walks past the others and they watch him drift into the woods.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE WOODS - DAY

               Andy slumps down onto a rock. Sets down his pistol and takes 
               out his handi-talk radio and, with difficulty, activates it. 
               His gun slides off the rock into the dirt.

               Lucy, at the switchboard, speaks over her headset.

                                     LUCY
                         Andy, is that you?... I can hardly

                         Tell Dan, we found where... it 
                         happened... Ghostwood Forest, about 
                         three miles east of the highway... 
                         tell Dan...

                              (quietly, tenderly)
                         Andy, are you okay? Sweetie?

                                     ANDY
                         I didn't cry... but Lucy... it's 
                         horrible... oh, God...

               He can't fight it. He starts to cry.

               Steadman backs his four-wheel vehicle up to the back door, 
               throws open the rear gate and goes into an open equipment 
               room.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Cooper guides Donna into the interrogation room and closes 
               the door. Cooper studies her.

                                     COOPER
                         Have a seat, Donna.

               Bobby's parents and Gilman White are talking near the exit, 
               as Bobby is released by a Deputy from the holding cell area. 
               Bobby looks at his parents, then sees Mike waiting by a water 
               cooler near the front desk, where Lucy is typing. Bobby walks 
               over to Mike.

                                     MIKE
                         Hey, buddy.

                                     BOBBY
                         Hey, Snake, we're outta here.

                                     MIKE
                         Just a sec', Donna's in there.

                                     BOBBY
                              (low and angry)
                         You straightened her out yet?

                                     MIKE
                         I don't know what's up with her, 
                         man.

                                     BOBBY
                         Forget her. I got it figured. Laura 
                         and her. We're lookin' at some 
                         freakin' biker. And some freakin' 
                         biker is gonna get his head busted 
                         open.

                         Who is it?

               Lucy pauses in her typing and slightly turns her head towards 
               them. Bobby picks up on it.

                         Come out here.

               They head for the exit, passing his parents and lawyer.

                              (formal but sympathetic)
                         Robert, I'll be at home this evening 
                         if you need a sympathetic ear.

                                     BOBBY
                         I don't need any damn sympathetic 
                         anything.

               Bobby and Mike leave the building.

                         You mean to tell me you and Laura 
                         went on this picnic alone, just the 
                         two of you?

                                     DONNA
                         What's wrong with that?

                                     COOPER
                         Deep into the woods, not another 
                         soul around--

                                     DONNA
                         Is there some law against having a 
                         picnic?

                                     COOPER
                         Donna, this is interesting to me, 
                         because with just the two of you out 
                         there--

               He turns on the VCR with the remote and we see the video of 
               the picnic.

                                     COOPER
                         I can't for the life of me figure 
                         out how these pictures got taken.

               Donna, feeling trapped and frightened, thinks fast.

                                     DONNA
                         Oh. Oh, that. That's easy. There was 
                         a hiker, came along with a backpack 
                         and we asked her to take the pictures.

                                     COOPER
                         What was her name?

                                     DONNA
                         I don't think we ever asked her. Or 
                         I forget. Maybe we did, I don't 
                         remember.

                                     COOPER
                              (non-threatening)
                         Donna... who are you protecting?

                                     DONNA
                         Nobody. That's what really happened.

                                     COOPER
                         Does the person's name start with 
                         the letter "J"?

                                     DONNA
                              (blushing)
                         I told you, she didn't tell us her 
                         name.

                                     COOPER
                         Donna, this is serious business. 
                         More serious than a girl falling in 
                         love with someone other than her 
                         boyfriend. Much more serious than 
                         you know.

               Donna remains silent. We hear a beep, an intercom on the 
               desk activating.

                                     LUCY'S VOICE
                         Agent Cooper, the Sheriff's ready to 
                         roll up to the site and I've got 
                         something else for you here.

                                     COOPER
                              (into the speaker)
                         You can come on in.
                              (to Donna)
                         I know Laura was your best friend. 
                         You've been through a lot today. 
                         We're finished here--for the time 
                         being.

               Donna rises. She exits. Steadman and Lucy enter.

                                     STEADMAN
                         Tell Agent Cooper what you heard 
                         Lucy.

                                     LUCY
                         Okay. Now, after you were done with 
                         Bobby? And he was taken back to his 
                         cell? Well, then his parents were 
                         standing by the door, with his lawyer, 
                         and Bobby, he was released and he 
                         came out and he saw his friend Mike, 
                         who was down by the water cooler, 
                         which is near my desk--

                                     COOPER
                         Uh-huh, uh-huh--

                                     LUCY
                         Okay, okay. Well, I pretended to be 
                         typing but I was typing what Mike 
                         and Bobby were saying, well they 
                         didn't say exactly who it was that 
                         they were talking about but anyway 
                         here's what they were saying--

               She offers him a typed page. He doesn't take it

                                     COOPER
                         They said the guy we're looking for 
                         is a biker.

                                     LUCY
                              (crestfallen)
                         Yeah...

                                     STEADMAN
                              (amazed again)
                         Yeah.

               Cooper turns on the VCR with the remote, fast forwards the 
               picture, then lets it run at normal speed until Donna moves 
               up extremely close to the lens. He freezes the frame and 
               points to a partial reflection of a motorcycle in the pupil 
               of her eye.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MOUNTAIN OVERLOOK - DAY

               A motorcycle is parked on a high crest, overlooking a wooded 
               valley and the town in the deep background. We hear the sound 
               of SIRENS wailing in the distance.

               James Hurley sits on a rock. His eyes red, his face torn 
               with grief. He holds a small envelope in one hand. His other 
               hand holds something protectively in a closed fist.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               HIS HAND

               As it opens and we see he's holding a gold necklace in the 
               shape of half of a heart. He rubs it lovingly and closes his 
               hand again.

               INT. MOUNTAINSIDE CAVE - DAY

               In the darkness, we see a powerful beam of light sweep slowly 
               across the walls, revealing random patterns of spayed blood. 
               The light follows the trail of the blood across a dirt floor 
               and up a raised mound of blood-saturated dirt.

               On top of the mound is the other half of the heart-shaped 
               gold necklace and just below it a folded piece of paper. 
               Something is written on the paper in what could be blood.

               We see it is Dale Cooper holding the flashlight. Behind him 
               are Steadman and some other officers. Cooper reaches in with 
               a gloved hand, gently turns over the note and reads...

                                   FIRE. WALK WITH ME.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A TV SET

               On the monitor is a news report showing location video footage 
               of Cooper, Steadman and the other officers emerging from the 
               mountainside cave.

               During above we pull back to discover we're in a cheaply 
               panelled and furnished living room.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The Double "R" Diner waitress, wearing a bathrobe and smoking 
               a cigarette, is watching the set in her living room. She 
               flicks her cigarette into the ashtray, unable to take her 
               eyes off the set.

               Her husband, LEO JOHNSON, a lanky, sinewy, pallid man of 
               thirty, pomaded hair, wearing a torn t-shirt, dirty jeans 
               and white socks, his heavy boots nearby on the floor. He 
               holds an open bottle of creme de menthe.

                                     SHELLY
                         Lord, I can't believe it. I can't 
                         believe it.

               Leo has not taken his eyes off the ashtray.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                              (politely)
                         Shelly... turn off the TV.

                                     SHELLY
                         Why? Why? I went to see this--

               She turns to him. Sees the look on his face. Gets up 
               immediately and turns off the television.

                                     LEO
                         Shelly, sit down here a minute and 
                         help me out.

               She sits obediently. He still hasn't looked at her.

                                     LEO
                         What kind of cigarettes do you smoke?

                                     SHELLY
                         Whatever's around.

                                     LEO
                         No you don't.
                              (he picks up a butt 
                              from the ashtray)
                         You smoke these.
                              (he picks up a 
                              different brand butt)
                         What are these doing here?

                                     SHELLY
                         Come on, Leo, I get different packs 
                         at the diner. Me and Norma.

               Pause.

                                     LEO
                         There's two things, Shelly. First, 
                         this house should be cleaned up for 
                         me when I come home... I mean clean.

                                     SHELLY
                         Okay--

               He holds up a hand and silences her instantly.

                                     LEO
                              (evenly)
                         Number two. You smoke one brand of 
                         cigarettes from now on. Because if I 
                         ever see two different brands of 
                         cigarettes in any ashtray in this 
                         house again, I'm gonna snap your 
                         neck like a twig.

               Trembling, he takes a big swig of creme de menthe and locks 
               eyes with her.

                                     SHELLY
                         You got nothing to worry about with 
                         me, darlin'.

               She forces a smile. He looks at her hard. Right through her.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - DAY

               We drift from the hotel over to "The Grange"; a large, 
               adjacent manor house, the private home of Benjamin Home.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. GRANGE - CLOSER ANGLE - DAY

               In an upstairs window, we see JOHNNY HORNE, Benjamin Horne's 
               twenty-seven year old son, standing alone, looking out over 
               the lawn. He turns away from the window.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. JOHNNY HORNE'S BEDROOM - DAY

               Johnny throws himself down to a sprawling position on the 
               floor and we see that the room is filled with large, expensive 
               toys. He begins to bang his head on a exquisite, doll house 
               replica of "The Grange" itself.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               With every impact, the furniture and small figurines inside 
               bounce violently up and down.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SYLVIA HORNE, Johnny's mother, Benjamin's wife, and Audrey 
               Horne, her daughter, sit at the dining room table, having 
               tea from a sterling tea service. Strained silence. Audrey 
               stares at the heel of her black leather pump. Sylvia hears 
               approaching footsteps and presses a hand to her forehead in 
               exasperation. A NURSE enters the room.

                                     NURSE
                         Mrs. Horne, I think it might help if 
                         you'd talk to Johnny yourself--

                                     SYLVIA
                              (pained sarcasm)
                         Oh, you think it might help? You 
                         tell Johnny, one more time, that 
                         Laura is not coming to work with him 
                         this afternoon, tomorrow afternoon 
                         or any afternoon. What is so difficult 
                         to understand about that?

                         I know I promised not to call there,

                         I know. It's okay.

               He reaches down, turns up the sound on the small television 
               and glances out the back window, up the small hill towards 
               his house.

               Cooper and Steadman are being lead into a back room by ALICE 
               BRADY, a uniformed bank guard. During below, she retrieves 
               Laura's safety deposit box.

                              (slightly hysterical)
                         I knew Laura she was always so nice--

                         Oh, I couldn't tell you exactly, 
                         there are so many boxes here--

                                     COOPER
                         You don't keep records.

                                     ALICE
                         Well we have plenty of paper work as 
                         it is, you know, with a town this

                         Can you tell me how long Laura has 
                         had the box?

                                     ALICE
                         I'd say about six months, I could 
                         check for you--

                         give me the box, m'am, we'll take it 
                         from here.

               Cooper takes the box. He and Steadman enter a smaller, privacy 
               room. Cooper sets the box down and opens it with the key he 
               found in Laura's diary. He reaches inside and lifts out the 
               sole item in the box.

               Just touching the edge of the pages, Cooper leafs through 
               the magazine. A thick, rubber-band wrapped packet of one 
               hundred dollar bills fall out.

               about, taking their seats. Prominent among them is Benjamin 
               Horne. Seated near him are Katherine and Pete Martell. 
               Cooper's eye catches Giovanna Packard as she enters. He almost 
               does a double take. He leans over to Sheriff Steadman and 
               asks discreetly...

                         Died in a boating accident last year. 
                         Andrew Packard practically built 
                         this town. Brought her back from 
                         Italy four years ago. Left her 
                         everything. Which didn't exactly 
                         please Packard's sister.

                         line outside her door.

               Benjamin Horne crosses to Giovanna, with a greeting of 
               unctuous sympathy.

                                     STEADMAN
                         My advice is, take a number.

                         I'm not big on crowds.

                         Benjamin Horne. Local big-wig. Owns 
                         half the town. He's not after her, 
                         he's after her land.

               At the podium, with some considerable effort, DWAYNE MILFORD, 
               the frail, eighty-six year old Mayor of Twin Peaks, nearing 
               the end of his 23rd consecutive term, gavels the meeting to 
               order and speaks into the microphone.

                         Ladies and gentlemen, if I could 
                         have your attention...
                              (smacks the microphone)
                         ...is this thing on?! Is this thing 
                         on?!

               Steadman steps in beside Milford, pats him encouragingly on 
               the back and adjusts the microphone so Milford can speak 
               into it more directly.

                         grief... the grief that flies to 
                         death. The tragic death of young 
                         Miss Palmer, so beautiful, so 
                         innocent. And this grief is attended 
                         by fear. Tonight it preoccupies us. 
                         And to help us assuage our fears, I 
                         give you Sheriff Steadman.

               He yields to Steadman, who first helps Milford to his seat.

                                     STEADMAN
                         Folks, I'll get right to the point. 
                         Laura Palmer was brutally murdered. 
                         It looks like Sharon Pulaski barely 
                         escaped the same fate. When Sharon 
                         turned up across the state line, 
                         this became a matter for the FBI. 
                         And after hearing what Agent Dale 
                         Cooper had to tell me, I, for one, 
                         am grateful for his and the Bureau's 
                         help. I think you'll feel the same 
                         way. Agent Cooper?

               He yields the microphone to Dale Cooper.

                                     COOPER
                         Ladies and Gentlemen, Federal Bureau 
                         of Investigation, Special Agent Dale 
                         Cooper. Kidnapping. Rape. Murder. 
                         These are words you're fortunate 
                         enough not to hear very often in 
                         your town. I wish I could tell you 
                         that you won't hear them again. But 
                         these are the facts; one year ago, 
                         almost to the day, in a town in the 
                         southwest corner of this state, the 
                         body of a girl named Teresa Banks 
                         was found. She had no family, no one 
                         came forward to claim her body. It 
                         was hardly even news. Until today.
                              (a stir runs through 
                              the room)
                         There are irrefutable similarities 
                         that for obvious reasons I will not 
                         specify, that lead us to conclude 
                         that Laura Palmer is the second, and 
                         Sharon Pulaski would have been the 
                         third victim, of the same killer.
                              (the room is abuzz)
                         There is a chance that the person 
                         who committed these crimes is someone 
                         from this town, possibly even someone 
                         you know. You are the leaders of 
                         this community. It's vitally important 
                         that this not turn into a witch hunt. 
                         I would like to propose that you 
                         enact some specific measures to 
                         protect the innocent and bring the 
                         guilty to justice...

               He consults his notes.

                                     COOPER
                         I would propose a public service 
                         announcement over local media asking 
                         for any information regarding these 
                         crimes, with a hotline number, manned 
                         by volunteers or community-funded 
                         operators, to field and sort through 
                         these calls... an investigation like 
                         this can turn on the most seemingly 
                         insignificant piece of information. 
                         I would also strongly suggest that 
                         you impose a temporary curfew for 
                         those under eighteen years of age. 
                         Keeping your kids off the streets 
                         now will teach them a degree of 
                         caution that may protect them in the 
                         days and weeks to come. I will remind 
                         you that these crimes occurred at 
                         night.

               EXT. SPARKWOOD MOUNTAIN - NIGHT

               The sound of wind through the pines. An owl hoots.

                                                             FADE TO BLACK:

                                       END ACT FOUR

                                         ACT FIVE

               FADE IN:

               EXT. TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT

               The gazebo in the empty square. Silence.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. INTERSECTION - NIGHT

               Where Sparkwood Road meets Highway "21", a traffic light 
               cycles from green to yellow to red. A cold wind sets the 
               light swinging.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. DOUBLE "R" DINER - NIGHT

               A few cars in the lot. The dinner crowd at the counter, 
               seeming to huddle together against the darkness.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. HIGHWAY "21" - NIGHT

               A group of motorcycle riders, the group we saw under credits, 
               glide by the Roadhouse in formation.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE HAYWARD HOUSE - NIGHT

               Warm lights in the windows against the cold night.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HAYWARD HOUSE STAIRWELL - NIGHT

               Donna Hayward stands silently on the stairwell, eavesdropping 
               on a conversation in the living room below, between her father 
               Dr. Hayward and her mother, EILEEN HAYWARD, a beautiful, 
               pale women, early forties, confined to a wheel chair, a 
               blanket covering her paralyzed legs.

                                     HAYWARD
                              (quietly, 
                              confidentially)
                         --Leland held up all through the 
                         day, I don't know that I could have 
                         done the same--

                                     EILEEN
                         The poor dear... poor Sarah...

                                     HAYWARD
                         Eileen, the brutality... the madness 
                         of it...

                                     EILEEN
                         I know...
                              (reaches for his hand)

                                     HAYWARD
                         They're not releasing many details. 
                         Wisely, I think. At the scene, where 
                         it happened... no one else knows 
                         this... they found part of a necklace, 
                         Laura's necklace. Half of a golden 
                         heart. She was wearing it in a video 
                         they found... I'm telling you this 
                         for a reason; Donna was in that video 
                         with her... they don't know who shot 
                         the video or who else was with them... 
                         but they think the killer may have 
                         the other half of that heart...

               Alarmed, Donna starts to slowly creep back up the stairs, 
               undetected.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HAYWARD HOUSE UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               Donna creeps down the carpeted corridor and into her bedroom.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DONNA'S BEDROOM NIGHT

               As Donna enters, HARRIET, Donna's thirteen year old whiz-kid 
               sister, lies on the bed, chewing on a pencil, writing a poem. 
               A radio is on softly in background.

                                     HARRIET
                         Which do you like better, "the blossom 
                         of the evening" or the "full flower 
                         of the evening"?

                                     DONNA
                              (closes the door, 
                              hushed)
                         Now listen to me, squirt, this is 
                         serious.

                                     HARRIET
                         Well, this is serious too.

                                     DONNA
                         Shhhhh... I'm going out the window 
                         in a few minutes and you're going to 
                         cover for me--

                                     HARRIET
                         Aren't you aware that there's a 
                         curfew? They just announced it on 
                         the radio--

                                     DONNA
                         I know there's a curfew, Einstein, 
                         that's why I need you to cover for 
                         me.

                                     HARRIET
                         I suppose this'll include a phone 
                         conversation with Mike, Mr. Bonehead 
                         Boyfriend.

                                     DONNA
                         This is about Laura. And it's really 
                         serious.

                                     HARRIET
                         Check.

               They squeeze each other's hands with strong and pure sisterly 
               affection. Donna puts on her jacket, slides open the window.

                                     DONNA
                         I'm gonna need to borrow your bike.

                                     HARRIET
                         Oh, well then put a little air in 
                         the back tire.

                                     DONNA
                         Don't forget to brush your teeth.

               Donna steps out into the branches of a large oak tree.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. HAYWARD HOUSE - NIGHT

               Donna drops silently to the ground from the oak tree and 
               creeps around the house, out of sight of the windows. She 
               ducks alongside a hedge edging the yard and into an alley 
               behind the house.

               Donna takes Harriet's bike, leaning against the side of the 
               garage, climbs on the bike and pedals down the deserted alley.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT

               Donna rides silently through the quiet streets and turns 
               onto the Highway 21 service road.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT

               Mike Nelson and Bobby Briggs are loitering by the magazine 
               rack, slightly beered-up. They're waiting for a CUSTOMER at 
               the register to exit. He finally does. The CASHIER says to 
               Mike and Bobby...

                                     CASHIER
                         Okay, bring it here. Make it fast.

               Mike quickly lugs a case of beer to the counter. Bobby throws 
               down some bills. The Cashier rings up the sale.

                                     BOBBY
                              (a strange smile)
                         Fuel for the party animal.

                                     CASHIER
                         You guys better stay off the streets 
                         with that; there's a curfew tonight.

               Bobby picks up the case and they quickly exit.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT

               They climb into Bobby's convertible. Both crack open a cool 
               one and chug it as Bobby revs up the engine.

                                     BOBBY
                         That biker? That "J" must be for 
                         James... James Hurley.

                                     MIKE
                         What're we gonna do about it?

                                     BOBBY
                         They weren't at "Hemingway's", 
                         bastards are hidin' out!

                                     MIKE
                         There's always some of those eggheads 
                         hangin' out at the Roadhouse.

                                     BOBBY
                         We're gonna go down there...

                                     MIKE
                         No, first we're gonna get Donna and 
                         get some answers.

                                     BOBBY
                         Let's boogie.

               They speed off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. POOL HALL - NIGHT

               Donna rides up and leans her bike against the side of a crude, 
               one-story cinderblock building with a sign that reads: "21" 
               BILLIARDS: RACK 'EM UP." Donna enters.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. POOL HALL - NIGHT

               Five tables under low lights, two being used. Rough PATRONS 
               sit at small formica tables, drinking beer and watching the 
               players. All eyes hook onto Donna, the only woman in the 
               joint.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BOBBY'S CONVERTIBLE - NIGHT

               Bobby and Mike cruise down the street. They both finish their 
               beers and toss the cans into the road. They pull up and park 
               in front of Donna's house. Mike hops over the door and starts 
               towards the door.

                                     BOBBY
                         Don't take any more crap from that 
                         pretty bitch.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. HAYWARD HOUSE FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

               Mike reaches the door and rings the doorbell.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DONNA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Harriet hears the doorbell, goes to the window, looks out 
               and sees Mike standing at the door and Bobby in the car at 
               the curb. She droops down on the bed.

                                     HARRIET
                              (to herself)

               EXT. HAYWARD HOUSE FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

               Dr. Hayward opens the door.

                                     MIKE
                         Hi, Dr. Hayward, I'd like to talk to 
                         Donna?

                                     HAYWARD
                              (smells the beer)
                         She's upstairs getting ready for 
                         bed, Mike. Hope you're not drinking 
                         and driving.

                                     MIKE
                         We're all pretty broken up about 
                         what happened today. Besides, Bobby's 
                         driving.

                                     HAYWARD
                              (pause, firmly)
                         I'll see if she wants to come down. 
                         Mike, if you wouldn't mind waiting 
                         out here.

               Dr. Hayward closes the door. Mike turns, makes a "what can 
               you do" gesture to Bobby.

                                     BOBBY
                              (yells back to him)
                         Get it in gear, Snake!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Dr. Hayward knocks on the door and enters Donna's bedroom

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A contrite Harriet sits on the bed, waiting, as her father 
               enters.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Where's your sister?

                                     HARRIET
                         I'm gonna tell it to you and I'm 
                         gonna tell it to you straight.

                                     HAYWARD
                         All right.

                                     HARRIET
                         See that window?

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Sheriff's Office... Sheriff's out 
                         right now, Dr. Hayward, but I can 
                         patch you through to him...

               She patches the phone line into a radio dispatch line.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The Sheriff's cruiser is parked among the crush of cars in 
               the roadhouse parking lot.

               Steadman and Cooper are in the front seat. Cooper is whittling 
               a small stick with a pocket knife. Through the windshield, 
               they have a prime view of "Hemingway's", behind the Roadhouse 
               building. About twenty motorcycles, mostly Harleys, are parked 
               outside.

               We hear the cruiser's two-way radio kick on.

                                     LUCY'S VOICE
                         Sheriff, I got a call for you from 
                         Dr. Hayward...

                              and responding)
                         Put him through...

                                                                  INTERCUT:

               INT. HAYWARD HOUSE SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               Dr. Hayward on the phone. Harriet peeks out at him from the 
               bedroom door.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Dan, my daughter Donna's snuck out 
                         of the house, I don't know where she 
                         went, I'm very worried about her.

               Cooper nods, not surprised.

                                     STEADMAN
                         You rest easy. I'll put out an all 
                         points for her, we'll keep our eyes 
                         peeled

                                     HAYWARD
                         Thanks, Dan. Keep me posted

                                     STEADMAN
                         You bet.

               Hayward hangs up. STAY with Steadman and Cooper.

                                     COOPER
                         Of course she went out.

                                     STEADMAN
                         Meaning what?

                                     COOPER
                         How else is she gonna lead us to 
                         that biker?

                                     STEADMAN
                              (trying not to appear 
                              confused)
                         Right.

                                     COOPER
                              (pause; continues to 
                              whittle)
                         You know why I'm whittling?

                                     STEADMAN
                              (playing along)
                         Why are you whittling?

                                     COOPER
                         Because that's the kind of thing you 
                         do in a town where a yellow light 
                         still means slow down, not speed up.
                              (he smiles)
                         Couple a' months of this and I'll 
                         have that clarinet I always wanted.

               He whistles "Rhapsody in Blue" again. Steadman looks at him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. HAYWARD HOUSE - NIGHT

               Dr. Hayward opens the front door. Mike hastily puts out his 
               cigarette. We hear the whine of Mrs. Hayward's electric 
               wheelchair approaching the front door.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Mike, Donna's not here. I've notified 
                         the sheriff...

                                     MIKE
                         What do you mean, she snuck out?

                                     HAYWARD
                         Maybe you have some idea of where 
                         she might have gone, maybe you could 
                         help us find her.

                                     MIKE
                         We'll find her. Don't you worry.

               He runs back to Bobby's car, jumps in.

                                     MIKE
                         Roadhouse.

               Bobby floors it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Donna looks at her watch, looks around uneasily. The pool 
               players and patrons are grouped around the room, watching 
               her, whispering to each other about her. SHORTY, the 
               Neanderthal-looking pool hall owner, comes out from the 
               backroom through a beaded curtain and approaches Donna.

                         Sweetheart...

               She takes a step back from him.

                                     SHORTY
                         ...hey, settle down, is your name 
                         Donna?

                                     DONNA
                         Yeah.

                         Police were by here earlier. Joey 
                         said he'll meet you at the roadhouse.

               Donna gets on her bike and heads off down the road to the 
               Roadhouse, which we can see in the distance.

               Steadman and Cooper watch Mike and Bobby head into the

                         There's liable to be a little trouble 
                         this evening.

               Steadman looks at him. Takes a sip of coffee. And a bite of 
               doughnut.

               A warm but slightly seedy honky-tonk. A GIRL SINGER in black 
               leather is up on the small stage, fronting a four-piece, 
               avant-garde rock COMBO. She's singing a song called, "The 
               Nightingale."

               At a quiet booth near the back, Ed Hurley and Norma Jennings 
               are holding hands across the table.

                                     NORMA
                         Drapes?

                                     ED
                         Drapes. Lots of 'em.

                                     NORMA
                         Ed, please, you know how I feel about 
                         you; don't do it for me, do it for 
                         yourself, pull the pin, it's Tammy 
                         Wynette time, darlin'.

                                     ED
                         Yeah? What about you and Hank?

                                     NORMA
                              (obviously frightened 
                              at the thought)
                         I told you, I'm gonna give Hank his 
                         walkin' papers.

                                     ED
                         Before or after he gets his parole?

                                     NORMA
                         Ed, I love you, I'm gonna do what's 
                         right... for both of us.

                                     ED
                              (making light of it)
                         Your sweetheart's husband's in the 
                         joint for manslaughter, the word 
                         "parole" has a nasty ring to it.

               She manages a smile. Looking up, Ed sees Mike and Bobby enter 
               the Roadhouse, look around and head for the bar.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               FIVE BIKERS

               Some of the clean-cut group we saw during opening credits, 
               seated at a table down front, watching the singer. One of 
               them, JOEY, spots Mike and Bobby at the bar.

                                     JOEY
                              (looks at his watch, 
                              to the others)
                         Mutt and Jeff just crawled in.

               Mike and Bobby see Joey and the bikers. Bobby points a 
               menacing finger at Joey.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE ROADHOUSE - NIGHT

               Donna parks her bike beside the Roadhouse and heads for the 
               door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. STEADMAN'S CRUISER - NIGHT

               Steadman and Cooper watch Donna enter the Roadhouse.

                                     COOPER
                              (still whittling)
                         Looks like sooner than later.

               He finishes whittling, looks at the stick, puts it in his 
               mouth and blows; he's made a whistle.

                                     COOPER
                         Why don't you whistle for a little 
                         back-up?

               Steadman picks up his radio microphone.

                                     STEADMAN
                              (the slightest bit 
                              testy)
                         I can see which way the wind's 
                         blowing.
                              (into the mic)
                         Lucy, this is Dan, can we get a back-
                         up unit down here at the Roadhouse? 
                         Make that two back-up units. And 
                         call Will Hayward, tell him we found 
                         his daughter and she's fine.

               He looks over at Cooper. Cooper makes a "thumbs-up."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ROADHOUSE - NIGHT

               Donna enters the Roadhouse and looks around. She stops short 
               when she sees Mike and Bobby at the bar. Mike sees Donna.

                                     DONNA
                              (to herself)
                         Damn...

                                     MIKE
                              (yells)
                         Hey! Everybody's looking for you! 
                         What are you sneakin' around for?!

               Reaction throughout the bar. Mike and Bobby rise and start 
               towards her. Ed looks up from the back booth, sees them. 
               Donna sees Joey and the other bikers at the front of the 
               room. Mike and Bobby see her looking at Joey and put two and 
               two together. Mike grabs Donna.

                                     MIKE
                         It's the same thing! You and Laura 
                         are exactly the same!

                                     DONNA
                         Take your hands off me!

               Mike pushes Donna hard against the wall. Joey and the other 
               bikers rise. The Singer stops singing, the band starts to 
               tail off. Ed rises from his booth.

                                     NORMA
                         Watch your back, Eddie.

                                     ED
                              (to Mike, crossing 
                              the room)
                         That's enough!

               As Ed moves towards Mike, Bobby dips a hand into his letter 
               jacket pocket and slips on a set of brass knuckles. The bikers 
               start towards Mike and Bobby.

                                     DONNA
                         You heard him, stay away from me!

                                     MIKE
                         I didn't hear dick!

               Ed moves past Bobby and grabs Mike's arm. Bobby hits down on 
               the back of Ed's head with the knuckles and Ed goes down 
               with a groan.

                                     BOBBY
                         Lights out, Mr. Goodwrench.

               The band members are already packing their instruments. 
               Patrons are backing away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE BIKERS

               Close the last few yards with a rush and the fight is on. 
               Mike lets go of Donna. She backs into the shadows. The 
               fighting is hard and vicious. Mike and Bobby have a size and 
               weight advantage, and are given to dirty fighting, but it's 
               countered by the bikers superior numbers and technique. 
               Approaching SIRENS are heard in the distance.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. STEADMAN'S CRUISER - NIGHT

               As they watch patrons pile out the front exit and the sounds 
               of the fight reach them, Steadman goes to open his door. 
               Cooper stops him.

                                     COOPER
                         Not just yet

               Steadman stops.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ROADHOUSE - NIGHT

               Joey hears the sirens, sees Donna slipping away, says to his 
               compatriots...

                                     JOEY
                         You guys got it covered?

                                     ANOTHER BIKER
                         No sweat.

               The biker knocks Mike back with an uppercut. The SIRENS are 
               very close now. Joey moves over to Donna, grabs her by the 
               hand.

                                     DONNA
                         Joey--

                                     JOEY
                         Come with me.
                              (lowering his voice)
                         I'll take you to James.

               He leads her towards a rear exit. The fight continues behind 
               them.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ROADHOUSE - NIGHT

               As Joey and Donna exit the rear of the roadhouse, two State 
               Trooper patrol cars are roaring into the parking lot. They 
               slam to a halt near the front entrance and four TROOPERS 
               pour out of the cars towards the Roadhouse.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. STEADMAN'S CRUISER - NIGHT

               Steadman and Cooper watch Donna and Joey hop onto the back 
               of his motorcycle and he stomps the engine to life. Steadman 
               and Cooper look at each other.

                                     STEADMAN
                         Joey Paulson. That's a "J."

                                     COOPER
                         He's taking her to somebody else.

               Steadman looks at him again.

                                     STEADMAN
                         I suppose you want me to follow them 
                         at a discreet distance.

                                     COOPER
                         Dan, you're all right.

               Steadman starts the car.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Joey and Donna ride out a rear driveway exit. Steadman and 
               Cooper follow at a discreet distance.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Donna grabs Joey's back. Joey looks in his rearview mirror.

                                                                  INTERCUT:

               Joey sees Steadman's cruiser behind them.

                              (to Donna)
                         Hold on!

               Joey guns it up Sparkwood Mountain Road.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                              (deadpan)
                         Gee, you think they spotted us?

               Joey reaches the top of the hill, glances behind him, smiles, 
               then turns right off the road and into the woods. Within 
               moments they completely disappear. Pause. Steadman's cruiser 
               reaches the top of the hill and continues straight past the 
               turnoff.

               Steadman's cruiser is stopped by the side of this remote 
               road.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Steadman and Cooper have the windows open, listening. Cooper 
               takes a deep breath.

                                     COOPER
                         Man... smell those trees. Smell those 
                         Ponderosa Pines.

               We hear a far-off sound of a motor; it could be a motorcycle.

                                     STEADMAN
                         I think I hear it.

               The sound fades.

                         Logging road. The only access is 
                         from the Packard Mill.

               He starts the engine and executes a fast turn.

                                     STEADMAN
                              (angry at himself)
                         And I told Hayward his daughter was 
                         okay.

                                     COOPER
                         My fault, Dan, not yours.

               The cruiser flies down the road past a sign that reads: 
               "PACKARD MILL EXIT, 5 MILES."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

               A quiet clearing in the woods. SOUND of an approaching 
               motorcycle. Joey and Donna drive out of the woods into the 
               clearing. Joey stops the cycle. Donna gets off. Joey turns 
               off the engine. Night sounds and silence. They wait. We hear 
               sirens, way off in the distance.

               Donna hears the sound of a motorcycle. It comes closer. James 
               Hurley rides into the clearing on his cycle. He nods to Joey.

                                     JAMES
                         Thanks, Joey.

                                     JOEY
                         No problem, James.

               Joey fires up his cycle, nods to Donna and rides off, James 
               kills the engine and gets off his cycle. The sound of Joey's 
               bike fades away.

               James and Donna look at each other. They embrace.

                                     DONNA
                         She loved you so much. You must be 
                         dying inside.

               They separate.

                                     JAMES
                         And you...
                              (a different thought)
                         I still can't believe it. I don't 
                         know if I'll ever believe it. I'll 
                         never see her again.
                              (fights back tears)

                                     DONNA
                         They're looking for you, I didn't 
                         tell them anything, but I have to 
                         tell you--

                                     JAMES
                         I'm gonna talk to them. But I think 
                         they're going to lock me up--

                                     DONNA
                         Why?

                                     JAMES
                         I don't have any alibi for last night--
                              (anguished)
                         I was with her, I saw her last night. 
                         She snuck out, we went riding. Out 
                         here. I have to explain this to you.

               Donna's silent, waiting.

                                     JAMES
                         We had a fight. She told me some 
                         things. About her, about herself. 
                         She said, "There are things about 
                         me. Even Donna doesn't know me."

                                     DONNA
                         What do you mean?

                                     JAMES
                         I'm telling you, there were things 
                         she was involved with, things she 
                         let herself get pulled into, things 
                         she thought you'd hate her for.

                                     DONNA
                         Tell me what you're talking about.

                                     JAMES
                         She told me these things, then she 
                         said she wanted me to be a part of 
                         it, she wanted to be with me but she 
                         couldn't help herself...

                                     DONNA
                         James...

                                     JAMES
                         She wanted me to get high with her 
                         last night. She was different, she 
                         was on something. It was kind of 
                         like a nightmare... Donna, she was a 
                         different person. This is why I had 
                         to see you, it all makes some kind 
                         of terrible sense that she died, 
                         that someone killed her, I don't 
                         know, I can't explain it--

                                     DONNA
                              (leveling with him)
                         I knew her. I knew her better than 
                         she thought.

                                     JAMES
                         Did she ever tell you any of this?

                                     DONNA
                         She didn't have to. Sometimes it was 
                         just a look on her face. There were 
                         things that Mike and Bobby said--

                                     JAMES
                         Mike and Bobby. Those bastards! They 
                         were involved with this, I don't 
                         know how exactly--but she said you 
                         weren't in on any of it.

                                     DONNA
                         I was her friend. I wanted to help 
                         her but whenever we got too close to 
                         it she always seemed too ashamed--

                                     JAMES
                         I got really mad at her last night, 
                         she was screaming stuff at me, crazy 
                         stuff, people she was seeing, people 
                         she met through Mike and Bobby, people 
                         she started seeing again, and Donna, 
                         she said something about a guy getting 
                         killed--

                                     DONNA
                         Who?

                                     JAMES
                         She didn't say, but she said Bobby 
                         told her that he killed this guy--

                                     DONNA
                         Oh my God...

                                     JAMES
                         I didn't know whether to believe any 
                         of it, half the time she wasn't making 
                         any sense, but then when they found 
                         her this morning...

                                     DONNA
                         James, what happened last night?

                                     JAMES
                         She was hysterical, I couldn't calm 
                         her down, it was after midnight, we 
                         started driving down the Hill, I 
                         could hardly keep her on the bike, I 
                         was trying to hold onto her, it was 
                         like she wanted to jump off right 
                         onto the highway--we stopped at the 
                         light at Sparkwood and "21" and she 
                         did something so strange, she grabbed 
                         me around the neck and she screamed 
                         she loved me--I looked in her eyes, 
                         they were clear, it was like she was 
                         Laura again. She was so sad. She 
                         sounded so desperate, I'll never 
                         forget it... then she ran off... 
                         that was the last time I saw her... 
                         the way she said it, that she loved 
                         me... I let her go and she died...

               He can't fight back the tears. She starts to cry. They blindly 
               move into each others arms.

                                     DONNA
                         It's not your fault... it's not your 
                         fault...

               Her face moves up close to his. Their tears intermingle.

                                     DONNA
                         It's okay... it's okay...

               She strokes the back of his head. He squeezes her. The 
               comforting moves more towards need.

                                     DONNA
                         James... James, it's okay...

               His lips find hers. They kiss with urgent, building passion, 
               yielding to it and to each other. Then something stops them 
               both simultaneously. They pull slightly away and look at 
               each other.

                                     DONNA
                         Oh my God...

                                     JAMES
                         I'm sorry.

                                     DONNA
                         Oh my God...

               She touches his cheek lightly. He looks at her.

                                     JAMES
                         I changed my mind. I'm not sorry.

               She gently lays her head on his shoulder. Approaching SIRENS 
               are heard again in the distance.

                                     JAMES
                              (reacting to the sirens)
                         I've got to go to the police. I'm 
                         gonna tell 'em what I told you. I 
                         don't have an alibi. After she left 
                         I just rode around most of the night. 
                         When Bobby finds out about me and 
                         Laura--

                                     DONNA
                         I think they already know.

                                     JAMES
                         I want you to watch out for those 
                         two.

                                     DONNA
                              (remembering)
                         James, that necklace you gave Laura, 
                         the other half of the gold heart, 
                         you've got to give it to me.

                                     JAMES
                         Why?

                                     DONNA
                         They found the other half, where she 
                         was killed. They think the killer 
                         has the other half. If you go down 
                         there with the necklace and no alibi--

                                     JAMES
                         What about you?

                                     DONNA
                         I'll get rid of it.

                                     JAMES
                         No--

                                     DONNA
                         I'll hide it somewhere.

                                     JAMES
                         All right.
                              (looks at her directly)
                         Let's bury it, right here.

               She senses that this act is about what just happened between 
               them. With the heel of his boot, James digs out a shallow 
               trench. He opens his hand, they both look at the necklace. 
               He lets the necklace slide out of his hand into the hole. 
               She kneels down and covers the necklace with dirt. James 
               reaches back, comes up with a white rock and uses it to mark 
               the burial spot.

               The sirens come closer.

                                     JAMES
                         We should go. I'll take you home--

                                     DONNA
                         We shouldn't be seen together. I 
                         snuck out to see you, there's a curfew--

                                     JAMES
                         Climb on.

               They move to his cycle. He climbs on and starts it. She gets 
               on the back. He turns back to her, she slides her arms around 
               him. They take off. Up through the woods, towards the highway.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. DIRT PATH - NIGHT

               Donna and James ride through the woods. They come to a sharp 
               crest, onto the surface of the highway and speed off past 
               the sign that reads: "PACKARD MILL EXIT 5 MILES."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. STEADMAN'S CRUISER - NIGHT

               Steadman and Cooper sit parked off the exit, watching the 
               highway and the Mill Road. Cooper's leaning out of the window, 
               looking up at the night sky.

                                     COOPER
                              (overawed)
                         There's the Little Dipper... Orion's 
                         belt... I never saw so many stars...

               They hear James' approaching motorcycle. Moments later it 
               flies by their line of sight.

                                     COOPER
                         What goes around, comes around.

               Steadman steers the cruiser out after them, hits the siren 
               and lights.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. JAMES' MOTORCYCLE - NIGHT

               James looks back at the Sheriff's cruiser and decides not to 
               run. He slows and pulls off the side of the road. Moments 
               later, Steadman's cruiser pulls up behind them.

                                                                  INTERCUT:

               INT. STEADMAN'S CRUISER - NIGHT

               Steadman sees who's on the bike.

                                     STEADMAN
                         That's not Joey that's James Hurley.

                                     COOPER
                         He'll do.

               Steadman draws his gun, picks up the microphone and flips on 
               his external speaker.

                                     STEADMAN
                              (amplified)
                         James, stand away from the bike, 
                         stand away from the girl and put 
                         your hands on top of your head.

               James follows the instructions.

                                     DONNA
                              (moving towards 
                              Steadman)
                         He didn't do anything!

                                     COOPER
                         She's probably right.

               Exasperated, Steadman looks at him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION - NIGHT

               A couple of TV NEWS CREWS and some REPORTERS are set up 
               outside the station, as Steadman drives up in the cruiser. 
               The Crews move in and tape Steadman and Cooper as they escort 
               Donna and James into the station. James is wearing handcuffs.

                                     NEWSMEN
                              (variously)
                         Sheriff, is he a suspect? What's his 
                         name? Is he being charged? What about 
                         the girl, are they both suspects? 
                         Sheriff, what can you tell us?

                                     STEADMAN
                         Nothing for you folks at this time... 
                         no comment.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - NIGHT

               Seated near the front desk, Dr. Hayward rises as Steadman 
               and Cooper enter with Donna and James. Andy Brennan comes 
               towards them as well.

                                     STEADMAN
                         Will, I'm gonna release her to you 
                         but I want her back up here for 
                         questioning first thing in the 
                         morning... Andy, give him a phone 
                         call and take James into holding--

                                     JAMES
                         My mom's out of town.

                                     STEADMAN
                         We're gonna have to hold you 
                         overnight.

                                     ANDY
                         Dan, we've got those guys from the 
                         Roadhouse back there--

                                     COOPER
                         Separate cell.

               Before Andy leads James off, Donna touches James' arm. 
               Hayward, Steadman and Cooper notice the tenderness in her 
               gesture. James eyes move from Donna, to Hayward and back to 
               Donna.

                                     JAMES
                         It's gonna be all right.

               Andy and James move off.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Thank you, Dan.

               Hayward and Donna move towards a side door. Hayward puts an 
               arm around his daughter and they exit.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION SIDE EXIT - NIGHT

               On a side of the building away from the reporters, Hayward 
               opens the car door for Donna and she gets in.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HAYWARD'S CAR - NIGHT

               Hayward gets in beside Donna and closes the door.

                                     DONNA
                         I'm sorry, Dad.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Donna, I'm sure you understand what 
                         you've put your and mother and I 
                         through tonight. I also know you 
                         well enough to know you wouldn't 
                         have done it unless you had a very 
                         good reason.
                              (she nods)
                         But we do have another problem facing 
                         us, young lady...
                              (mock stern)
                         Where... is Harriet's bicycle?

                                     DONNA
                              (breathes a sigh of 
                              relief, has to think)
                         I left it at the Roadhouse.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Well, we'll go pick it up.
                              (starts the car)
                         And I understand you promised Harriet 
                         you'd put some air in the back tire.

                                     DONNA
                         Yes I did.

               Hayward smiles, touches her head, lovingly, looks at her.

                                     HAYWARD
                         We're so thankful to have a daughter 
                         like you.

               Her eyes glisten, she smiles, nods, looks away. Hayward drives 
               off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION HOLDING CELL AREA - NIGHT

               Andy finishes putting James' belt and the contents of his 
               pockets in a large envelope, then leads James through a 
               doorway into the holding cell area corridor.

               On their way to the cell, they pass Mike and Bobby in a 
               separate cell. Mike and Bobby rise when they see James. Bobby 
               fixates on James, points a finger at him as he passes.

                                     BOBBY
                         You.

               James stops and looks at him, as Andy opens the door of a 
               nearby cell.

                                     BOBBY
                         When you least expect it.

                                     ANDY
                         That could constitute a threat, 
                         Briggs.

                                     BOBBY
                              (cold as ice)
                         Oh, gee, I'm sorry.

               James just looks at him.

                                     ANDY
                         Let's go, James.

               James enters the cell. Andy closes and locks the door.

                                     ANDY
                         Stick your hands out.

               James sticks out his hands, Andy unlocks and removes the 
               handcuffs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION FRONT DESK - NIGHT

               A weary Steadman and Cooper meet near the water cooler.

                                     STEADMAN
                              (hands him a Dixie 
                              cup)
                         Buy you a drink?

                                     COOPER
                         Dan, I forgot to ask you; can you 
                         recommend to me a good, inexpensive 
                         hotel or motel? Now it doesn't have 
                         to be fancy and I mean that.

                                     STEADMAN
                         I can get you a good rate up at the 
                         Great Northern.

                                     COOPER
                         Because my guess is I'm going to be 
                         here for awhile and you know a lot 
                         of these motel chains that advertise 
                         on TV promise a reasonable rate but 
                         then you get there and it's a 
                         different story. All I need is a 
                         bed, a bathroom, a telephone and 
                         sometimes a television, in the 
                         unlikely event that one day I'll get 
                         a chance to knock off early.

                                     STEADMAN
                              (slight pause)
                         I can get you a good rate up at the 
                         Great Northern.

                                     COOPER
                         Sold.

               Cooper offers his hand. Steadman shakes it.

                                     COOPER
                              (looks at his watch)
                         Tomorrow comes early.

                                     STEADMAN
                         I'll have Lucy make the arrangements 
                         for you with the Hotel.

                                     COOPER
                         I'll get my gear together.
                              (Cooper starts off, 
                              switches on his tape 
                              recorder, speaks 
                              into the mic)
                         Diane, it's 12:28 a.m., looks like 
                         I'll be staying locally at a place 
                         called the Great Northern Hotel--
                         Sheriffs getting me a rate...

               He's gone. Steadman crosses back towards his office, where 
               Lucy calls him from the switchboard.

                                     LUCY
                         Sheriff, just got a call from Mrs. 
                         Packard up at the Lodge, a possible 
                         prowler?

                                     STEADMAN
                         Probably raccoons in the garbage 
                         again. I'll take it, Lucy, tell 'em 
                         I'm on my way.

               Steadman heats out.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. PACKARD LODGE - NIGHT

               Steadman's cruiser turns off the steep road and into the 
               driveway of Blue Pine Lodge, the large, log-cabin Packard 
               homestead. He parks near the rear of the house, exits the 
               car and moves towards the house.

               As Steadman nears the kitchen door, Giovanna opens it.

                                     GIOVANNA
                         Hello Sheriff.

                                     STEADMAN
                         Hey, Jo... understand there's a 
                         prowler up here.

                                     GIOVANNA
                              (as he enters)
                         Yes there is. Right over here.

               She pulls him the rest of the way in, turns off the lights 
               and in the dark, they kiss passionately.

                                     GIOVANNA
                         I've been wanting to do that all 
                         day. I felt so sad. So alone.

                                     STEADMAN
                              (strokes her hair)
                         Well, the sheriffs here now.

               They kiss again. He holds her. They are standing in front of 
               a large picture window, with a panoramic view looking down 
               over the Saw Mill on Black Lake.

                                     GIOVANNA
                         I used to think it was so peaceful 
                         here. Everything's changed. Do you 
                         feel it?
                              (looks out the window)
                         Can anything ever be the same again?

               We see a closer angle of the log jam where Laura's body was 
               found

                                     STEADMAN
                         It must've happened about this time. 
                         Twenty-four hours ago...

                                     GIOVANNA
                         I'm afraid.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KATHERINE PACKARD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Darkness. Pete Martell is asleep in bed, snoring slightly. 
               Katherine, in a bathrobe, stands looking out the window, her 
               face gnarled in anger, looking at the Sheriff's cruiser parked 
               outside. She has the phone receiver in her hand, punching in 
               a number. She waits. The phone is answered

                                     KATHERINE
                              (whispers)
                         He's here again...
                              (she listens)
                         Alright.

               She hangs up the phone.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL OFFICE - NIGHT

               Benjamin Horne quietly hangs up the phone.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SAWMILL DOCK - NIGHT

               Close shot of the log-jam where the body was found, logs 
               gently thudding together, as they bob in the black water.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT

               The gazebo.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. TWIN PEAKS - NIGHT

               The quiet business district. Sparkwood Hill looms up behind 
               the Town Hall and the train station.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ED HURLEY'S GAS STATION - NIGHT

               No lights. No sign of life.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE ROADHOUSE DANCE HALL - NIGHT

               The sign's neon dancers flicker back and forth.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. INTERSECTION - NIGHT

               Sparkwood Road and Highway "21." The traffic light cycles 
               from green to yellow to red.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. DOUBLE "R" DINER - NIGHT

               Parking lot empty. Two LONERS at the counter.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. HIGHWAY "21" - NIGHT

               Empty.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

               Thick woods. Sound of footsteps treading softly though the 
               brush.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. WOODS CLEARING - NIGHT

               A flashlight beam finds the white rock that James used to 
               cover the necklace. A gloved hand reaches in, moves the rock, 
               digs for and uncovers the necklace. The hand takes the 
               necklace, then replaces the rock. The light switches off.

                                                             FADE TO BLACK:

                                         THE END
