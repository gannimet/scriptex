               FADE IN:

               INT. GREAT NORTHERN DALE COOPER'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Through the walls from adjacent rooms we hear whooping and 
               hollering, a blowing of horns and ratcheting noise makers. 
               It sounds like a rodeo in Times Square on New Year's Eve. 
               DALE COOPER sits up in bed, distraught, sleepless. From the 
               bedside table, he picks up his watch and tape recorder.

                                     COOPER
                         Diane, it's 4:28 a.m., I've just 
                         been woken up by the most god-awful 
                         racket, which you can probably hear 
                         over the sound of my voice...
                              (holds up the recorder 
                              to capture the sound)
                         Can you hear that?
                              (holds it up again)
                         I've experienced nothing at the Great 
                         Northern up until this moment but 
                         the most pleasant, courteous service 
                         imaginable, but this only goes to 
                         prove the point that the minute a 
                         traveler leaves home he loses almost 
                         100% of his ability to control his 
                         environment. Diane, I'm wondering if 
                         you could overnight express to me 
                         two pair of those Ear-Pillow Silicon 
                         Ear Plugs I used the last time I had 
                         to visit New York. Naturally I didn't 
                         bring them with me on this trip 
                         because I didn't think they'd be 
                         necessary...

               He holds the recorder up again.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GREAT NORTHERN DINING ROOM - DAY

               Dale Cooper, dressed and slightly bleary-eyed, enters and 
               takes the corner table. Off screen, through a door to a 
               private dining room, we HEAR a rowdy group of about twelve 
               men and women singing a bawdy Icelandic drinking song. Harried 
               WAITRESSES come and go out of the room, bearing huge platters 
               of food. TRUDY approaches Cooper.

                                     TRUDY
                              (reaching Cooper)
                         Coffee?

                                     COOPER
                         Please.
                              (she pours)
                         What's with the choir practice?

                                     TRUDY
                         Business junket. From Iceland. Got 
                         in about three this morning.

                                     COOPER
                         They're on my floor.

                                     TRUDY
                         Lucky you.

                                     COOPER
                         It'll take them a day or so to reset 
                         their biological clocks.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Hope the herring holds out.

               He holds out his cup for a refill. She pours. The Icelanders 
               start another song

               AUDREY HORNE enters, looking for Cooper, brightens, moves to 
               his table.

                                     AUDREY
                         How are you?

                                     COOPER
                         To be perfectly honest, Audrey, I'm 
                         tired and a little on edge.

                                     AUDREY
                              (sits, saddened)
                         Oh.
                              (hoping for approval)
                         I got a job.

                                     COOPER
                         That's excellent--

                                     AUDREY
                         And I thought maybe now I could help 
                         you with your case, guess where I'm--

                                     COOPER
                              (finishing, rising)
                         You'll have to excuse me, Audrey, 
                         I'm running late this morning, I 
                         only have time for coffee.

                                     AUDREY
                         Maybe I could go with you.

                                     COOPER
                              (leaving change, taking 
                              receipt)
                         Thursdays were traditionally a school 
                         day when I was your age.

                                     AUDREY
                         I can't believe you were ever my 
                         age.

                                     COOPER
                         I've got the pictures to prove it. 
                         See you later, Audrey.

                                     AUDREY
                         See you later. Bye.

               She wistfully watches him go. Digs her nails into her palms. 
               The Icelandic group finishes another song and roars with 
               laughter. JERRY HORNE enters from the private dining room, 
               carrying a small suitcase, laughing, along with the head 
               Icelander, EINER THORSON. Jerry claps Einer on the back, 
               they shake hands and embrace and say something in Icelandic. 
               Jerry turns back to the room and yells to the Icelanders 
               inside...

                                     JERRY
                         My brother is going to love you guys!

               Jerry exits the dining room.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL OFFICE - DAY

               BEN HORNE is behind his desk when Jerry hurries in with his 
               bag.

                                     JERRY
                         I bring you greetings from the 
                         fertile, treeless tundra of Iceland!  
                         Brother Ben, there aren't two twigs 
                         to rub together on the whole island - 
                         wait'll these guys get a load of the 
                         woods!

                                     BEN
                         By six this morning we had complaints 
                         from nearly every guest in the hotel, 
                         what are they on, nitrous oxide?

                                     JERRY
                         I have had more serious fun in two 
                         days with these nordic animals and 
                         Ben, I'm in love, her name is Heba, 
                         she's a giant snow queen with a smile 
                         like sunrise on a ice floe, you could 
                         go blind looking at this girl--look 
                         at this.
                              (takes a large package 
                              out of his bag)
                         You see what she gave me? An entire 
                         leg lamb!
                              (unwraps it; huge and 
                              slightly grotesque)
                         Is that beautiful? Chunk some garlic 
                         in there, some crushed mint: 
                         rotisserie heaven--come on, you got 
                         to meet her--

                                     BEN
                         Let 'em sack out for a few hours 
                         first, now have they approved our 
                         proposal?

                                     TERRY
                              (refers to the 
                              Ghostwood project

                         Ben, hip pocket, glasnost on ice, 
                         they are insane for Ghostwood Estates. 
                         We're on the plane, they're begging 
                         me, "Jerry, please, let us write the 
                         check--you fill in the blanks."

                         Let's not be eager beavers until the 
                         ink's dry. You grab some down time. 
                         We've laid in a a gala reception for

                         nail the sale I'm thinking maybe

                         B-b-ben?

               A haggard, unshaven LELAND PALMER is standing in the doorway.

                                     BEN
                         Leland, what are you doing here?

                                     LELAND
                         I know the new investment group is 
                         arriving today... if there's anything 
                         I can do...

                                     BEN
                         Leland, the best thing you can do 
                         right now is follow the doctor's 
                         orders and go home, you need your 
                         rest--

                                     LELAND
                         I just feel... I just feel I need 
                         something, I need something to... to 
                         occupy my mind...
                              (close to tears)

                                     JERRY
                              (gestures behind 
                              Leland's back)
                         Check-out time.

                                     BEN
                         Take some time off, for god's sake, 
                         fly somewhere, take Sarah--

                                     LELAND
                              (unraveling)
                         I'm afraid to go...

               He crumbles into a chair. From the hallway, we hear the voices 
               of approaching ICELANDERS, singing another ribald song. Jerry 
               nimbly moves to the door and quietly shuts it. Ben tries to 
               hush Leland's sobs. The singers continue singing, directly 
               outside the door now. Then they move on... Ben and Jerry 
               breathe a sigh of relief. Ben points at Leland, then sticks 
               up his thumb, "get this guy out of here."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Cooper enters the apartment and is met by SHERIFF HARRY 
               TRUMAN, who is supervising the investigation of the apartment. 
               TROOPERS and two FORENSIC COPS in plain clothes are working.

                         What've we got, Harry?

                                     TRUMAN
                         Jacques Renault's a Canadian national, 
                         worked the local lumber fields until 
                         he put on a little excess tonnage a 
                         couple seasons ago. That's when he 
                         started tending bar at the Roadhouse.

                                     COOPER
                         Do you have any doughnuts here?

                                     TRUMAN
                         Andy?

               Gestures "doughnut", points to Cooper, to ANDY, who nods and 
               starts out.

                                     COOPER
                         Better wash that down with a cup of 
                         joe, I didn't sleep too well last 
                         night.

                                     TRUMAN
                              (gestures "coffee" to 
                              Andy before he exits)
                         You're looking a little peaked.

                                     COOPER
                         There's a large group of insane men 
                         staying on my floor. Where is Jacques 
                         Renault, Harry?

                                     TRUMAN
                         No one's seen him for two days. We've 
                         canvassed the building and the 
                         Roadhouse, I sent Hawk to roust his 
                         brother but it looks like Bernie 
                         skipped bail; no sign.

               Cooper looks up at a ceiling light fixture, as Doc Hayward 
               hangs up the phone and crosses to them.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Morning, Agent Cooper.

                                     COOPER
                              (still looking up)
                         Doc.

                                     HAYWARD
                         The blood on that shirt you found 
                         here is AB negative. It's not Laura's 
                         blood.

                                     COOPER
                         So that was Jacques Renault's blood 
                         on Leo Johnson's shirt.

               Truman and Doc look at each other. Doc goes back to the phone 
               and dials. Andy returns with Cooper's coffee and doughnut. 
               Cooper takes them, still looking up.

                                     COOPER
                         Thank you, Andy.
                              (takes a bite and a 
                              sip)
                         Could you hold these for a second?

               He hands the coffee and doughnut back to Andy, looks up again.

                                     COOPER
                         Where's Leo Johnson, Harry?

                                     TRUMAN
                         The APB went out last night, nothing 
                         yet.

                                     COOPER
                         Give me a leg up here, would you 
                         Harry?

               Truman cradles his hands, Cooper takes out a pair of calipers, 
               steps into the cradle and Truman boosts his up and out of 
               frame. Doc Hayward hangs up the phone and returns.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Jacques Renault's blood is AB 
                         negative.

                                     COOPER
                              (out of frame)
                         Thank you, Doc.

               Cooper comes back down into frame, gingerly holding a dusty 
               copy of "FLESH WORLD" Magazine in the calipers. He sets it 
               down on a table, blows off some dust and turns pages with 
               the calipers.

                                     TRUMAN
                         "Flesh World" again.

                                     COOPER
                         Harry, remember this ad with the 
                         picture of Ronette Pulaski?

               He turns to the page in question. There's an opened envelope 
               between the pages, with a letter inside. Cooper carefully 
               removes the envelope.

                                     TRUMAN
                         We traced that ad. Came into the 
                         magazine in a plain envelope, no 
                         name--

                                     COOPER
                         Here's how it works. The magazine's 
                         a clearing house. Readers write 
                         letters in response to ads and send 
                         them into the magazine, then the 
                         magazine mails those letters on to 
                         the advertiser. No direct contact.
                              (shows him the envelope)
                         Ronette received her letters at this 
                         P.O. Box.

                                     TRUMAN
                         That's a local zip code.

                                     COOPER
                         My guess is this P.O. box will be 
                         registered in the name of Jacques 
                         Renault. Let's see who was writing 
                         to Ronette. Post marked Georgia.

               He takes out the letter. There are a couple of snapshots 
               inside as well. Cooper, Truman and Doc look at the snapshots.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Good night.

                                     TRUMAN
                         That guy's no Georgia peach.

                                     COOPER
                         Somehow the beard ruins the effect 
                         of the lingerie, don't you think?
                              (scans the letter)
                         Poor bastard.
                              (folds it up, goes 
                              back to the magazine)
                         By the way, Harry, did you happen to 
                         notice the picture of Leo Johnson 
                         and his truck on this page?

               Points to the picture of a silver truck cab which we saw 
               before.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. JOHNSON HOUSE - DAY

               Leo's truck, the truck in the picture, is parked outside.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. JOHNSON'S KITCHEN - DAY

               SHELLY JOHNSON is serving a hot breakfast to BOBBY BRIGGS. 
               He's dressed, she's in a robe. She sets the plate down in 
               front of him. He eats ravenously.

                                     BOBBY
                         I love when you cook for me.

                                     SHELLY
                         Leo hates my cooking.

                                     BOBBY
                         Leo has missed the boat with you, 
                         baby. The biggest mistake of your 
                         life was dropping out of the eleventh 
                         grade and marrying that roadhog.

                                     SHELLY
                              (amused and excited)
                         What would you do if he walked in 
                         right now?

                                     BOBBY
                              (a hot look)
                         Come here.
                              (pats his leg)
                         Come  here.

               She sits on his leg. He hugs her, kisses her neck, looks up, 
               mock surprise.

                                     BOBBY
                         Hey, Leo, how's it going, man? What 
                         a surprise!

               With a big smile he draws Shelly's nickel-plated revolver 
               out of the pocket of her robe and points it at the imaginary 
               Leo.

                                     BOBBY
                         Now, Leo, Shelly tells me you don't 
                         like her cooking. Tell you what, she 
                         and I, we're going to sit here while 
                         you cook breakfast for us, you 
                         scumbag, and if you so much as say 
                         one harsh word to this beautiful 
                         girl, I'm going to shoot your ugly 
                         face off. Okay, Leo?

               He smiles. Shelly laughs. They hear a car drive up outside. 
               Bobby looks out the window.

                                     BOBBY
                         Sheriff's deputy. Shelly, you tell 
                         him exactly what I told you to, just 
                         like we talked about, okay?

                                     SHELLY
                         Okay.

               The doorbell rings. Bobby kisses her, she goes to the door. 
               Bobby takes the gun and conceals himself in a room off the 
               kitchen. We hear voices.

                                     SHELLY'S VOICE
                         Hi... sure, come on in.

                                                                  INTERCUT:

               BOBBY'S POV

               The living room. Shelly is talking to Deputy Andy Brennan.

                                     ANDY
                         Do you know when Leo might be back?

                                     SHELLY
                         Sorry, he never tells me where he's 
                         going.

               She lights a smoke and sneaks a look back at Bobby. She winks. 
               Bobby smiles.

                                     SHELLY
                         They called and said you were looking 
                         for him, is Leo in some kind of 
                         trouble?

                                     ANDY
                              (looking into the 
                              kitchen)
                         We just need to talk to him.

                                     SHELLY
                         This isn't about Laura or anything 
                         is it?

                                     ANDY
                         Why do you say that?

                                     SHELLY
                         Well, I don't know. I did hear him 
                         talking to this guy the night he 
                         left--

                                     ANDY
                         Which guy?

                                     SHELLY
                         This guy Jacques Renault? They were 
                         outside by Leo's truck, I could hear 
                         'em, from over in the kitchen--

                                     ANDY
                         What did they say?

                                     SHELLY
                         I couldn't hear exactly. They were 
                         arguing but I did hear them mention 
                         her name, then they took off together.

                                     ANDY
                         Shelly, you call us the minute he 
                         gets in touch with you, you be careful 
                         of Leo--

                                     SHELLY
                         You don't have to tell me that twice. 
                         Thanks for stopping by, Andy.

               They move back to the door. Bobby puts the gun in his pocket. 
               Shelly comes back to the kitchen, Bobby grabs her and kisses 
               her passionately.

                                     SHELLY
                         How'd I do?

                                     BOBBY
                         You were great. God, you drive me 
                         crazy.

               The phone rings. Twice. Shelly answers, as Bobby still kisses 
               her.

                                     SHELLY
                         Hello?... hey, Leo, where you calling 
                         from?

               Bobby stops pawing her, gives her another signal. She 
               responds.

                                     SHELLY
                         What's that? Is anybody looking for 
                         you?
                              (Bobby shakes his 
                              head)
                         Leo, what would anybody be looking 
                         for you for?...
                              (Bobby nods, 
                              encouraging her to 
                              continue)
                         Leo, you know how paranoid you get 
                         when you've been popping bennies on 
                         the road a couple days... so, when 
                         you coming home?

               Bobby slips the gun into her hand. She looks at it, looks at 
               Bobby.

                                     SHELLY
                         Everything's fine, come on home, 
                         Leo... I miss you, too.

               She hangs up. Looks at the gun.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GAS FARM GARAGE - DAY

               BIG ED HURLEY and JAMES HURLEY are working together on an 
               engine. James is wrestling with some emotional demon. Ed 
               takes notice.

                                     JAMES
                         Mom came home yesterday.

                                     ED
                              (nods)
                         She in bad shape?

                                     JAMES
                         It's getting worse; every time she 
                         goes off on a drunk now, I half expect 
                         her to turn up dead. And part of 
                         me's thinking there's worse things 
                         that could happen.

                                     ED
                         Those are hard thoughts.

                                     JAMES
                              (almost overcome with 
                              emotion)
                         God, I'm... so ashamed of her.

                                     ED
                         That doesn't mean we give up. We 
                         have to keep trying.

                                     JAMES
                         What's left to do? Talk about it 
                         some more? She won't get help, she 
                         won't listen to either one of us--

                                     ED
                         I don't know what else we can do--

                                     JAMES
                         She's killing herself... I don't 
                         want to hate her, Ed, but if she 
                         won't let us help her sometimes I 
                         think it'd be better if she'd just 
                         get it over with...

               His tears finally come. Ed hugs him.

                                     ED
                         I know it's rough. But if we give up 
                         on her, who else is gonna give a 
                         damn?

               A car pulls up out front; we hear it trip the bell wires 
               near the pumps.

                                     JAMES
                              (pulling away, trying 
                              to make light)
                         ...been kind of a rough week.

               He goes out to the back. STAY WITH Ed. We hear a car door 
               open and close. Norma comes into the shop. Too many secrets 
               to rush into each other's arms.

                                     ED
                         Hey, good lookin'.

                                     NORMA
                         I hope you don't mind my coming.

                                     ED
                         No, no, Nadine won't be back from 
                         that patent attorney over in Fairvale 
                         for hours.

                                     NORMA
                         The famous silent drape runners.

                                     ED
                         She's already spending the millions.

                                     NORMA
                         Anyway, I have to put gas in my car 
                         like everybody else, right?

                                     ED
                         Right.

               Pause. Their smiles fade.

                                     NORMA
                         I didn't want to tell you over the 
                         phone. Hank got his parole.

                                     ED
                         Okay.

                                     NORMA
                         He's coming home, I mean back and 
                         I... haven't said anything to him, 
                         yet, I--

                                     ED
                         Hey, you don't have to explain.

                                     NORMA
                         I only saw him for a minute before 
                         we went into the hearing and he seemed 
                         so hopeful, it just didn't seem like 
                         the right time--

                                     ED
                         I understand.

                                     NORMA
                              (Pause)
                         Have you said anything to Nadine?

                                     ED
                              (trying not to lie)
                         I haven't yet, Norma.

                                     NORMA
                              (half-joking)
                         Waiting for me to go first?

                                     ED
                         No. It's just, the more I think 
                         about... Norma, Nadine's not a well 
                         woman.

                                     NORMA
                         What are you saying?

                                     ED
                         I don't know, darling--

                                     NORMA
                              (painfully realizing, 
                              pulling back)
                         I think I do.

                                     ED
                         Maybe the time isn't right, for either 
                         of us right now

                                     NORMA
                         We've only had to wait twenty years, 
                         what's a few more? We can always 
                         hold hands in the nursing home.
                              (almost laughs as she 
                              fights off her tears)

                                     ED
                         I don't ever want to hurt you, Norma.

                                     NORMA
                         Maybe that's our trouble, Ed, we 
                         never want to hurt anybody. We never 
                         just take what we want. But part of 
                         me's beginning to think that's how 
                         you get to the end of your life and 
                         don't have anything to slow for it?

                                     ED
                         Norma...

                                     NORMA
                              (trying desperately 
                              not to cry)
                         Don't call me. Not for a while, okay?

                                     ED
                         All right.

                                     NORMA
                         I love you, Ed.

               She goes. He watches.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               across the desk by EMORY BATTIS, the department store's forty-
               year old Director of Personnel.

                                     BATTIS
                         Please, please, come in, sit, sit, 
                         can I get you something to drink, 
                         Miss Horne, coffee?

                              (an admiring gaze)
                         My, my, I can remember when your 
                         father used to bring you down here 
                         when you were just a little girl--

                         Did you used to bounce me on your 
                         knee, Emory?

                         So did my father speak to you?

                         Yes, yes he did, and I can't tell 
                         you how excited we are, Audrey, that 
                         you want to come on board and put in

                         You don't exactly have to "sell" me 
                         on the place, do you?

                                     BATTIS
                              (nervous laugh)
                         I see your point, indeed I don't, no 
                         siree--

                                     AUDREY
                              (preening)
                         So... what did you have in mind for 
                         me?

                                     BATTIS
                              (looks, then nervously 
                              consults notes)
                         Let's see, let's see, I suppose 
                         driving a delivery truck is out of 
                         the question--
                              (laughs politely, she 
                              pretends to)
                         Well Audrey, per your father's 
                         suggestion, starting low, aiming 
                         high, etc... we thought perhaps the 
                         wrapping department.

                                     AUDREY
                         Wrapping?

                                     BATTIS
                         Boxes, gifts, etc, etc. Part time, 
                         after school.

                                     AUDREY
                         No, no, no, no; Emory, ix-nay on the 
                         oxes-bay.

                                     BATTIS
                         Certainly not the most glamorous job 
                         in the store, but then your father 
                         did specify--

                                     AUDREY
                         Emory, may I speak frankly?

                                     BATTIS
                         Oh please do.

                                     AUDREY
                         Let's talk retail.

                                     BATTIS
                         Sales?

                                     AUDREY
                         Perfume.

               A slight tremor runs across his features. She picks up on 
               it.

                                     BATTIS
                         One of our more sensitive areas. 
                         Expensive items, delicate customer 
                         relations--

                                     AUDREY
                         I'm afraid I've got my heart set on 
                         it.

                                     BATTIS
                              (more than reluctant)
                         I'd have to speak to your father--

                                     AUDREY
                         Emory, here's what we're going to 
                         do. You're going to to tell my father 
                         I'm busy as a bee wrapping boxes 
                         down with the drones and then you're 
                         going to put me to work behind the 
                         perfume counter this afternoon--
                              (before he can speak)
                         --because if you don't I'm going to 
                         rip my sweater in half and scream at 
                         the top of my lungs and tell my father 
                         you made a pass at me. Does that 
                         help clear things up for you? Emory?

               She grabs her sweater, ready to rip and scream.

                                     BATTIS
                         Yes. Yes.

                                     AUDREY
                              (knows what he needs)
                         Yes what?

                                     BATTIS
                         Yes, Ms. Horne.

               She sits back down, demurely arranges herself and smiles.

                                     AUDREY
                         Shall we get started on the paperwork?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. GAZEBO - DAY

               James Hurley is waiting in a park near a lake. DONNA HAYWARD 
               comes around a corner looking for him.

                                     DONNA
                         James?

               He turns, sees her, they embrace.

                                     DONNA
                         I got your note
                              (he still holds her)
                         Are you all right?

                                     JAMES
                         Donna, there's a few things I gotta 
                         say.

                                     DONNA
                         What?

                                     JAMES
                              (extremely difficult 
                              for him)
                         I told you my Dad died when I was 
                         ten?... He didn't die. We were living 
                         in San Francisco. He was a musician. 
                         He was a bum and he ran off and he 
                         left us, me and my mom.

                                     DONNA
                         I'm sorry.

                                     JAMES
                              (a rush of intensity)
                         My mom grew up out here. That's why 
                         we moved back. My mom was a writer, 
                         she was good, poems, short stories. 
                         She's an alcoholic.
                              (looks at her)
                         If you have a problem with this, I 
                         know you didn't ask to hear it...

                                     DONNA
                         I don't have a problem. You tell me.

                                     JAMES
                         It's true she was out of town this 
                         week, but she wasn't traveling. What 
                         she does is, she goes to another 
                         town, shacks up in some cheap hotel 
                         room with a couple bottles and picks 
                         up guys and...

               He's too ashamed to continue. She holds him.

                                     DONNA
                         It's all right.

                                     JAMES
                         I'm telling you this because I don't 
                         want to have any secrets from you, I 
                         don't want there to be any lies 
                         between us. It's the secrets people 
                         keep that destroy any chance they 
                         have for happiness and I don't want 
                         us to be like that...

                                     DONNA
                         We won't. We won't be.

               He kisses her, they hold on to each other.

                                     JAMES
                         We have to do what's right. What you 
                         said yesterday was true; if we don't 
                         do everything we can to figure out 
                         what happened to Laura it'll never 
                         go away, our whole lives--

                                     DONNA
                         We will, James.

                                     JAMES
                         She's out there, wandering like a 
                         restless spirit--

                                     DONNA
                         I feel it, too. We owe it to her.

                                     JAMES
                              (searingly honest)
                         And we owe it to ourselves or else 
                         somehow, someday Donna, she's going 
                         to come between us.

                                     DONNA
                         What can we do?

                                     JAMES
                         I've got an idea. Laura's cousin, 
                         this girl Madeleine, I talked to her 
                         yesterday, I think she could help 
                         us. I want to ask her to meet us at 
                         the diner today, is that alright?

                                     DONNA
                         Yes.

               He kisses her, ready to move off, she stops him, looks him 
               in the eye, strong.

                                     DONNA
                         Count on me, James. No secrets.

               He smiles, kisses her again and runs off to his bike, parked 
               nearby. She watches him go.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. JACQUES RENAULT'S APARTMENT/CORRIDOR - DAY

               CLOSE on a plate of doughnuts as they're passed among the 
               cops working at the scene. STAY WITH Dale Cooper as he takes 
               one and grabs a bite as he looks through some drawers in the 
               kitchen. He's wearing surgical gloves. He takes a bill out 
               of the drawer, lays it thoughtfully on the counter. He opens 
               a cabinet; a red-and-black plaid shirt hangs inside. A number 
               of postcards and photographs are thumbtacked to the inside 
               of the door.

               DEPUTY HAWK arrives, hands a packet of letters to Truman, 
               they cross to Cooper.

                                     HAWK
                         That P.O. box was registered to

                              (looking at the letters)
                         These are all from people responding 
                         to Ronette's ad in the magazine.
                              (look at Cooper)
                         Maybe there's something from someone 
                         we know.

                              (bothered)
                         There better not be.

                                     COOPER
                              (noticing something)
                         Hawk, hand me that magazine again, 
                         would you?

               Hawk does. Cooper pages through, looking for something.

                                     TRUMAN
                         What is it?

                                     COOPER
                         Those letters are addressed to two 
                         different ad numbers, Ronette's and 
                         another one... here it is.

               Cooper finds the second ad in the magazine.

                                     COOPER
                              (reading)
                         "Young student requires instruction 
                         in the ways of love. Only generous, 
                         mature men need apply."

                                                                  INTERCUT:

               THE MAGAZINE

               The ad features a color photograph of a girl in lingerie, 
               suggestively posed in front of dark red drapes. Her head has 
               been cropped from the photo.

               ON COOPER AND TRUMAN

               Cooper whips out his magnifying glass and examines the photo.

                                     COOPER
                         It's Laura.

                         Drapes?

               Cooper opens the cabinet, points to a color photo pinned to 
               the door of a small log cabin in the woods, hands the 
               magnifying glass to Harry. He looks through it at the photo...

                                                                  INTERCUT:

               PHOTOGRAPH OF LOG CABIN

               Through the magnifying glass, red drapes are visible in the 
               windows.

                         Red drapes. From my dream, Harry.
                              (he picks up the bill 
                              he set aside)
                         Can you think of a good reason why 
                         an apartment dweller like Jacques 
                         would buy fifty gallons of heating 
                         oil?

                         To heat a log cabin?

                         Jacques brother mentioned something 
                         about a place up near state line.

                         Pack a lunch, fellas. We're going to 
                         take a walk in the woods.

               OFF the cropped photo of Laura in the magazine...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DOUBLE R DINER - DAY

               Laura's cousin, MADELEINE FERGUSON enters, looks around. 
               James and Donna are seated at a booth.

                                     JAMES
                         Madeleine?

               She sees them, smiles, crosses over. James rises. Madeleine 
               sits across from them. There's a MAN sitting alone in the 
               next booth, his back to them.

                                     MADELEINE
                         Hi. Hi.

                                     DONNA
                         Hi, I'm Donna Hayward.

                                     MADELEINE
                         My friends call me Maddy. This is 
                         really nice of you guys. I don't 
                         really know anybody in town except 
                         Aunt Sarah and Uncle Leland. And the 
                         mood at the house, you can probably 
                         guess, isn't so great right now.

               Donna and James look at each other. James nods.

                                     JAMES
                         Maddy, would you like something to 
                         drink?

                                     MADELEINE
                         A cherry coke would be great.

                                     JAMES
                         You got it.

               James gets up, goes to the counter.

                                     DONNA
                         Madeleine, what we wanted to talk to 
                         you about... if I said you can't, 
                         really say a word of this to anybody 
                         else, not a soul, not even your aunt 
                         or uncle, would that be okay with 
                         you?

                                     MADELEINE
                              (lightly)
                         Sounds like some big secret.

                                     DONNA
                         It is. Madeleine, James and I knew 
                         Laura better than anyone. She was in 
                         some kind of terrible trouble before 
                         she died, worse than any of us could 
                         imagine--

                                     MADELEINE
                              (eyes widening)
                         What?

               James returns with her drink, sits.

                                     DONNA
                         I'd rather not say too much about 
                         things we can't prove yet.

                                     JAMES
                         In some ways, the less you know about 
                         it the better.

                                     MADELEINE
                         You said you can't prove it "yet."

                                     DONNA
                         We loved Laura. We're afraid the 
                         truth might never come out or that 
                         the person who killed her might never 
                         be caught. We've sworn on her memory 
                         not to let that happen.

                                     MADELEINE
                         ...my God. You know who did it?

                                     JAMES
                         We have some ideas.

                                     DONNA
                         We wanted to talk to you because we 
                         need your help.

                                     MADELEINE
                         What do you want me to do?

                                     DONNA
                         Laura used to talk about a hiding 
                         place she had, somewhere in her house, 
                         maybe her room, I'm not sure. Nobody 
                         else knew about it. We think she may 
                         have left something there that could 
                         lead us to the killer.

               Pause.

                                     MADELEINE
                         I'll help you.

                                     DONNA
                         You will?

                                     MADELEINE
                         Absolutely.

                                     JAMES
                         That's great.

                                     MADELEINE
                         You know, I didn't really know Laura 
                         that well, but I feel like I do, our 
                         folks were always telling us how 
                         much alike we were...

               As she speaks, CAMERA MOVES around and behind to the next 
               booth to reveal the Man sitting with his back to them: it's 
               HANK JENNINGS. He's heard the entire conversation. He takes 
               a slow sip of coffee. He's fingering his domino key chain.

               James, Donna and Madeleine rise and start out.

                                     DONNA
                         Will you call me if there's anything 
                         I can do?

                                     MADELEINE
                         I don't think there'll be any problem

                                     JAMES
                         Madeleine, this is really great.

                                     MADELEINE
                         Call me Maddy.

               They're out the door. Hank smiles. A few moments later, Shelly 
               and Norma enter, all dolled up from the beauty parlor, 
               laughing.

                                     SHELLY
                         --God, we look like a couple of 
                         refugee beauty queens.

                                     NORMA
                         Shelly, I don't think you know how 
                         good looking you really are.

                                     SHELLY
                         I sure never felt so glamorous, hope 
                         I don't chip a nail slinging these 
                         plates around--

               They laugh. They pass Hank's booth on the way back to the 
               kitchen.

                                     HANK
                         Hello, Norma.

               She turns and sees him, stops dead.

                                     NORMA
                         Hank...

                                     HANK
                         You look beautiful. You go to 
                         Natasha's?
                              (she nods, can't speak)
                         Surprised to see me?

                                     NORMA
                         Yes.

                                     HANK
                         Got out a day early. Model prisoners 
                         get all the breaks.

               Norma looks at Shelly, who starts back to the kitchen.

                                     HANK
                         Is that Leo's girl?

                                     NORMA
                         Wife.

                                     HANK
                         That Leo. So impulsive.
                              (a friendly remark)
                         Not much meat on her.
                              (a long look)
                         I don't expect a kiss or anything. 
                         Figure I have to earn my way back 
                         into your heart, Norma. But I intend 
                         to try.
                              (another look)
                         So, where do I start?  I'll wash 
                         dishes. Maybe work my way up to short 
                         order one of these days?

                                     NORMA
                         Washing dishes would be fine.

                                     HANK
                         Can I finish my coffee first, boss?

               He smiles and sips his coffee. They look at each other.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SHELLY

               In the kitchen, looking out at them. The TV is on the kitchen, 
               but the sound is off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE TELEVISION

               A silent scene from "Invitation to Love." MONTANA grabs CHET 
               by the lapels, yells at him, slaps him twice and pushes him 
               to the ground. Chet tries to rise.

               A high-heeled shoe steps onto Chet's chest, pushing him back 
               down. EMERALD. She laughs at him, throws herself in Montana's 
               arms. They kiss.

               Chet looks up at them, stricken. Montana laughs.

                                                             FADE TO BLACK:

                                        ACT THREE

               FADE IN:

               INT. DR. JACOBY'S OFFICE - DAY

               We don't immediately realize where we are. Seated in a half 
               circle of chairs are MAJOR BRIGGS, MRS. BRIGGS and Bobby, 
               who can't believe what he's hearing.

                                     MRS. BRIGGS
                         He's been spending more and more of 
                         his time alone in his room.

                                     MAJOR BRIGGS
                         It's become much more difficult to 
                         engage him in conversation.

                                     MRS. BRIGGS
                         Terrible mood swings.

                                     MAJOR BRIGGS
                         We've been told by the school that 
                         his attendance has become erratic at 
                         best.

                                     MRS. BRIGGS
                         And of course the recent trouble 
                         with public fighting. Both at the 
                         Roadhouse and the funeral.

               And now we see who they're talking to, sitting in a leather 
               chair, nodding sagely...

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         Are you using drugs, Bobby?

                                     BOBBY
                         No I'm not.

                                     MAJOR BRIGGS
                         Alcohol.

                                     MRS. BRIGGS
                         Alcohol's a drug.

                                     BOBBY
                         That's not what he meant.

                                     MRS. BRIGGS
                         Alcohol doesn't count?

                                     BOBBY
                         Everybody uses alcohol.

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         Are you unhappy, Bobby?

                                     BOBBY
                         Shouldn't I be?

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         That's not for me to say.

               Pause.

                                     BOBBY
                         Have you ever killed anybody?

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         Have you?

                                     BOBBY
                         My father has.

                                     MAJOR BRIGGS
                         During wartime.

                                     MRS. BRIGGS
                         That's different.

                                     BOBBY
                         Different from what?

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         Perhaps I should spend a few minutes 
                         with Robert alone.

                                     MAJOR BRIGGS
                         This is supposed to be family 
                         counseling.

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         And I'll need to spend some time 
                         alone with every member of the family. 
                         Bobby first.

                                     MAJOR BRIGGS
                         Fair enough.

                                     MRS. BRIGGS
                         Whatever you think best, Doctor.

               The Major and the Missus get up and leave the room.

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         Bobby, let's cut the crap.
                              (Bobby looks at him)
                         Do you feel that your parents don't 
                         understand what you're going through?

                                     BOBBY
                         That's a good one.

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         Let's talk about Laura.

                                     BOBBY
                         Okay. Let's talk about Laura.

                                     DR. JACOBY
                              (knows some secrets 
                              here)
                         What happened the first time you and 
                         Laura made love?

                                     BOBBY
                         What the hell kind of question is 
                         that?

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         Bobby... did you cry?

                                     BOBBY
                              (stunned; this is 
                              true)
                         Did I what?

                                     DR. JACOBY
                              (also true)
                         What did Laura do then? Did she laugh 
                         at you?

               Bobby's completely throw off his guard. Jacoby moves in.

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         Were you sad when Laura died?

                                     BOBBY
                         Laura wanted to die.

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         How do you know that?

                                     BOBBY
                              (rising emotion)
                         Because she told me.

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         What else did she tell you?
                              (silence)
                         Did she tell you there was no goodness 
                         in the world?

                                     BOBBY
                         She said people tried to be good but 
                         they were really sick and rotten, 
                         her most of all, and the harder she 
                         tried to be good the more rotten she 
                         felt because it didn't mean anything, 
                         because every time she tried to help 
                         the world be a better place something 
                         terrible came up inside her and pulled 
                         her back down into hell, it took her 
                         deeper and deeper into the blackest 
                         nightmare and every time it got harder 
                         to go back up to the light.

               Pause.

                                     DR. JACOBY
                              (on the case)
                         Did you sometimes have the feeling 
                         that Laura was harboring some awful 
                         secret?

                                     BOBBY
                         Yes.

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         Bad enough that she wanted to die 
                         because of it?

                                     BOBBY
                         Yes.

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         Bad enough that it drove her to 
                         consciously try to find people's 
                         weaknesses and prey on them, tempt 
                         them, break them down, make them do 
                         terrible, degrading things?

                                     BOBBY
                              (shocked and frightened)
                         Yes.

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         Laura wanted to corrupt people, 
                         because that's how she felt about 
                         herself--

                                     BOBBY
                              (near tears)
                         Yes.

               Pause.

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         Is that what happened to you, Bobby?

               Bobby dissolves into tears.

                                     DR. JACOBY
                              (gently)
                         Is that what Laura did to you?

                                     BOBBY
                         Yes. She made me... she wanted... so 
                         much... she made me sell drugs so 
                         she could have them... she made me...

               Bobby can't continue, buries his face in his hands. Jacoby 
               has had something essential confirmed. He rises, pats Bobby 
               sympathetically on the shoulder, offers him the bowl of...

                                     DR. JACOBY
                         Malted milk ball?

               Bobby shakes his head. Jacoby pops one in his mouth and chews, 
               thinking.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. WOODS - DAY

               A dense, dark forest.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. WOODS - DAY

               A number of police cars parked in a clearing, the jumping 
               off place for a search party. Cooper, Truman, Hawk and Doc 
               Hayward. They're preparing to go off into the woods, when 
               Andy speeds up in his patrol car and gets out.

                                     ANDY
                              (excited)
                         Sheriff, Leo Johnson's been gone two 
                         days, his wife hasn't seen him--

                                     TRUMAN
                         Okay, Andy--

                                     ANDY
                         But the thing is, I looked into the 
                         kitchen? She was having breakfast 
                         and the table was set for two.

                                     COOPER
                         Good work, Andy. You keep those eyes 
                         peeled.

               Andy beams with pride.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Andy, I want you to stay with the 
                         cars.
                              (Andy's disappointed)
                         I need someone to stay near the radio. 
                         We'll keep in touch on the walkies.

               Andy nods and starts back to the cars.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Hawk, lead the way.

               Hawk tunes up his sensory apparatus, nods, starts into the 
               woods. Cooper and Truman look at each other. Cooper nods.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Doc, you sure you're up for this?

                                     HAYWARD
                         In for a penny, in for a pound, Harry.

                                     TRUMAN
                         That's the spirit.

               They follow Hawk into the woods.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. WOODS - DAY

               A dark, dark grove. The air still and moist. A solitary 
               mournful bird call. Hawk stops, listens, examines the ground, 
               finds something that leads him on. Cooper, Truman and Hayward 
               follow.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. LOG LADY'S CABIN - DAY

               Hawk turns a corner and comes upon a simple, solidly 
               constructed log cabin in a clearing. It is not the cabin we 
               saw in the photograph in Jacques' apartment. Smoke rises 
               from the chimney. The others join Hawk in the clearing.

                                     COOPER
                         Not the one we're looking for.

                                     HAWK
                         Maybe, maybe not.

                                     TRUMAN
                         You might want to hang back a step, 
                         Doc.

                                     HAYWARD
                              (winded)
                         Might want to anyway.

               As a precaution, Hawk and Truman draw weapons and along with 
               Cooper start to advance. As they round the corner of the 
               cabin, they come face to face with the LOG LADY, carrying a 
               log.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Hello.

                                     LOG LADY
                         About time you got here.
                              (to herself)
                         They move so slowly when they're not 
                         afraid.

               She goes right inside the cabin. Pause. They look at each 
               other. The Log Lady appears in the doorway again.

                                     LOG LADY
                         Come on then. My log does not judge, 
                         it only records.

               She disappears again. They look at each other. Cooper nods. 
               Truman calls back.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Doc?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LOG LADY'S CABIN - DAY

               Truman, Cooper, Hawk and then Doc enter. One large room. 
               Simple kitchen, a bed in the corner. Table with six chairs, 
               six places with a log-motif tea setting. A boarded up 
               fireplace. Fire extinguishers and a bucket of water in each 
               corner. An axe, a saw and other woodcutting tools. Framed 
               picture of a lumberjack, on the mantle, beside a funereal 
               urn, with ashes. Log Lady goes to the kitchen, where she's 
               preparing tea.

                                     LOG LADY
                         I've got tea. I've got cookies. No 
                         cake.

                                     COOPER
                         That's very kind of you, but I don't 
                         know if we have time to--

               Hawk signals him to accept the invitation, then takes the 
               lead and sits at the table.

                                     HAWK
                         What kind of cookies?

                                     LOG LADY
                         Sugar. The owls won't see us in here.

               Hayward sits at the table beside Hawk.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Some tea would be very nice.

                                     LOG LADY
                              (to Truman and Cooper, 
                              annoyed)
                         Shut your eyes and you will burst 
                         into flames.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Thank you.

                                     COOPER
                         Thank you very much.

               Truman and Cooper sit. The Log Lady sets down a plate of 
               cookies on the table, along with a log-motif tea pot, then 
               she takes a seat.

                                     LOG LADY
                         We'll let it steep.

               Pause. Cooper reaches for a cookie. Log Lady lightly slaps 
               his hand.

                                     LOG LADY
                         Wait for the tea. The fish aren't 
                         running.

               Cooper. looks around, noticing all the firefighting equipment. 
               She looks at him, as if to say, "Don't laugh. I see everything 
               and it takes it's toll." Pause.

                                     COOPER
                         Do you use fire for cooking then?

                                     LOG LADY
                         I go to great lengths to keep it 
                         under control.

                                     TRUMAN
                         M'am, were you expecting us?

                                     LOG LADY
                         You're two days late. Clues may be 
                         as cold as the tea but that's your 
                         concern.
                              (pause)
                         My log saw something, something 
                         significant. There's no closer 
                         relationship than the logger with 
                         the tree.

               Pause. Cooper looks at Truman.

                                     TRUMAN
                         M'am, what did your log see?

                                     LOG LADY
                              (shakes her head)
                         Drink first and be ready for the 
                         truth..

               She checks the pot, decides it's ready and starts to pour. 
               Six cups. Formal manners.

                                     COOPER
                              (passing the plate 
                              around)
                         Lime, Harry?

                                     LOG LADY
                         My husband was a logging man.

                                     COOPER
                         Oh?

                                     LOG LADY
                         He met the devil. The devil took the 
                         form of fire. Fire is the devil hiding 
                         like a coward in the smoke.

                                     HAYWARD
                              (he knows her)
                         The day after the wedding, wasn't it 
                         Margaret?

               She looks away.

                                     HAWK
                              (to the Log Lady, 
                              comforting)
                         The wood holds many spirits, doesn't 
                         it Margaret?

               She nods. Pause. They nibble on cookies and drink their tea. 
               The Log Lady turns to Cooper.

                                     LOG LADY
                         You can ask it now.

                                     COOPER
                              (to the log; solemnly, 
                              respectfully)
                         What did you see that night? The 
                         night Laura Palmer, was killed?

                                     LOG LADY
                              (pause to the log)
                         Shhhh. Let me do the talking.
                              (she closes her eyes; 
                              this is hard for her)
                         Dark. Laughing. The owls were flying. 
                         Many things were blocked. Laughing. 
                         Two men. Two girls. Flashlights, in 
                         the woods, pass by, over the ridge. 
                         The owls were near. The dark was 
                         pressing in on her...
                              (calmer)
                         Quiet then. A gentle wind. Footsteps, 
                         later, one man pass by. All quiet. 
                         Screams, far away. Terrible. Terrible. 
                         One voice...

                                     COOPER
                              (quietly)
                         Man or girl?

                                     LOG LADY
                         Girl... Further up. Over the ridge 
                         The owl were silent.

               She opens her eyes, blinks. Takes a sip of tea. Hayward dries 
               the tears in his eyes.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. WOODS DAY

               A light mist falls. Hawk, Truman, Cooper and Hayward make 
               their way up the ridge through thick woods.

                                     COOPER
                         The two girls are Laura and Ronette.

                                     TRUMAN
                         The two men Jacques, maybe Leo?

                                     COOPER
                         Maybe.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Who's the third man?

               Hawk stops suddenly, gestures them to be quiet. He listens.

                                     HAWK
                         Do you hear it?

               They listen... Far away... music. An angelic voice, soft 
               chords.

                                     HAWK
                         This way.

               They continue on.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. WOODS SECOND CABIN - DAY

               Hawk, Truman, Cooper and Hayward emerge from a thick stand 
               into a clearing; on a rocky point above them stands the log 
               cabin seen in the photo at Jacques; apartment. Rundown, not 
               well maintained. Red drapes are visible in a window. Cooper 
               looks at the photo. It was shot from the angle they're viewing 
               it from now.

               The music issues from inside the cabin. The song ends. Pause. 
               The same song begins again.

               Truman draws his weapon and takes the lead. Hawk and Cooper 
               draw their weapons and follow. Hayward sits on a rock and 
               wipes his brow with a handkerchief.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SECOND CABIN - DAY

               The door creaks open, throwing the only light into the dark 
               room. Truman, Hawk and Cooper cautiously enter. The music is 
               louder. Cooper draws aside a set of the heavy, dusty red 
               drapes, letting more light into the room.

               On a simple record player, the tone arm pulled back over a 
               45 record, the song ends again, the stylus lifts, returns to 
               the outside, then back onto the outside edge of the record. 
               Scratches, pops, then the song starts again.

                                     COOPER
                              (under his breath)
                         ...and there's always music in the 
                         air..."

               Cooper lifts the stylus off the record. All three men proceed 
               with extreme care, trying not to move or disturb anything.

               The single room is dusty, trashy, a low-rent version of a 
               harem room: an overstuffed davenport, cheap oriental throw 
               rugs, tasseled satin pillows, empty bottles and full ashtrays.

               On a tripod, a 35 millimeter camera, facing a small photo 
               bay created by the drapes and pillows. Hawk checks it out.

                                     HAWK
                         There's film in here.

               Hawk takes out an evidence bag, removes the film.

               Cooper finds a spool of twine lying on the floor

               Another tripod shaped object, covered with a cloth. Truman 
               slowly draws the cloth off... a mynah bird in the cage reacts 
               drowsily, weak from hunger and thirst. A nameplate on the 
               cage reads... "O"

               Hawk draws their attention to dark stains on the wood and 
               one of the throw rugs. He examines it.

                                     HAWK
                         Blood.

               Cooper moves to look at it.

               Truman, backing up from the cage, hits a rocking chair which 
               rocks forward and hits a table, knocking over a lamp...

               Hawk, looking past Cooper, sees the lamp...

                                     HAWK
                         Watch out.

               Cooper avoids the lamp as it crashes to the floor. Something 
               skitters off the lamp and rolls under the davenport Hawk and 
               Cooper look at each other. Cooper reaches in under the 
               davenport, feels around, finds something. He pulls it out

                                                                  INTERCUT:

               POKER CHIP

               A thousand dollar chip, with a small chunk missing. It reads: 
               "ONE-EYED (J)ACK'S"

               Cooper and Hawk look at each other.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL BANQUET ROOM NIGHT

               A banner reads:

                 "FROM ICELAND TO TWIN PEAKS: A GREAT NORTHERN WELCOME!!"

               Festive, folksy Icelandic music, plays over the sound system. 
               The reception party is just under way. CITIZENS mingle with 
               the Icelanders, who cluster around the L-shaped buffet. The 
               Horne brothers mingle prominently. At the piano, Trudy leads 
               a group of Icelanders in an Icelandic version of Home on the 
               Range."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BANQUET ROOM ENTRANCE - NIGHT

               Script above the door reads, "TIMBER ROOM." A HOTEL EMPLOYEE 
               is at the door, checking a guest list as people arrive. PETE 
               and CATHERINE MARTELL reach the door.

                         Catherine Martell and spouse.

               They're checked off the list and enter. We follow them.

                         Cathy?

               She stops a passing WAITER with a tray of champagne. Takes 
               two glasses. Slugs one down.

                         A few belts and even you might start 
                         to look good to me.

               She knocks back the second one, replaces the glasses on the 
               Waiter's tray, takes another glass and moves off, leaving 
               Pete.

                         that there still remains a tremendous 
                         vestigial interest in the legends

                         connection to a natural, more 
                         primitive, almost pagan way of life,

                         smelling forest-dweller, which I 
                         suppose would correspond to your

                                                                    CUT TO:

               On a one-step riser at the end of the room, at a microphone.

                         Can I have your attention please?

               As the crowd congregates towards that side of the room.

                                     JERRY
                         First off, I want to thank you all 
                         for turning out tonight to welcome 
                         our neighbors from the magical island 
                         of Iceland. The Ghostwood Estates 
                         project is an important part of our 
                         future here in Twin Peaks, and there's 
                         no group we'd rather have as a partner 
                         in our future than--

               He's drowned out by the blaring sound of big band music from 
               the speakers.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               LELAND PALMER

               In the middle of the dance floor, he starts to go, a solitary 
               jitterbug. People clear out around him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BEN AND CATHERINE

               Re-entering the room. Ben exchanges a look with Jerry, who's 
               panicking. Ben whispers to Catherine.

                                     BEN
                         Dance with him.
                              (she gives him a look)
                         This is serious.

               Catherine moves out towards Leland.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               LELAND AND CATHERINE

               He slickly incorporates her into his dance and they commence 
               to cut a pretty mean rug. Leland is pouring down tears and 
               making little moaning sounds, but the crowd, happily clapping 
               along and half-soused, doesn't pick up those details.

                                                                  INTERCUT:

               BEN AND JERRY.

               Ben makes his way to his brother.

                                     BEN
                         Get Jacoby, get a net, get him out 
                         of my life.

               Jerry nods and moves off. Before he can get very far, he's 
               pulled out onto the floor by Heba and they begin to jitterbug.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DANCE FLOOR - HIGH ANGLE

               The Icelanders love this new dance craze and spill onto the 
               floor, doing their best to duplicate Leland's style...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               LELAND AND CATHERINE

               Leland picks up his pace. Catherine realizes she's dancing 
               with a man teetering on the edge of a meltdown.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               AUDREY

               Watching from behind a post, away from the dance floor. She's 
               crying.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Darkness. Madeleine creeps into the room, wearing a nightgown, 
               carrying a shoe box. A floorboard creaks. She gives a look 
               back upstairs, turns on a lamp, sits, picks up a phone and 
               quietly dials a number. Waits. Whispers.

                                     MADELEINE
                         Donna? It's Maddy... I was looking 
                         in Laura's closet and I couldn't 
                         find anything but I looked up and 
                         noticed there was a loose ceiling 
                         panel?... yes, that was her hiding 
                         place, I pushed the panel back, there 
                         was a shoe box up there...

               She takes off the cover of the box.

                                                                  INTERCUT:

               THE SHOE BOX

               We see four audio cassette tape cases inside. On the top 
               case we can read: "To Dr. Jacoby." There's a noise from 
               upstairs that startles her.

                                     MADELEINE
                         I'll meet you and James tomorrow. 
                         Bring a tape recorder.

               She hangs up, turns off the lamp, puts the cover back on the 
               shoe box and goes back out of the room.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Darkness. Sounds of the party continue elsewhere. As our 
               eyes become accustomed to the darkness, we see someone sitting 
               at Ben's desk and the red glow of a cigarette as they inhale.

               The door opens. Ben enters the room. Josie turns on the lamp 
               at the desk where she's seated. Ben crosses to the desk.

                                     BEN
                         Did anyone see you come in here?

                                     JOSIE
                         No.

                                     BEN
                         You do realize the risk if anyone 
                         sees us.

                                     JOSIE
                         Yes.

               He sits on the edge of the desk. Josie puts out her cigarette.

                                     JOSIE
                         How much longer, Benjamin?

                         Tomorrow night.

               They look at each other. She slowly extends her hand. He 
               takes her hand and kisses it tenderly. They look at each 
               other.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               LEO JOHNSON pulls up in a beat-up pick-up truck with a covered 
               pay-load, stops beside a small shed outside his half-finished 
               garage. He gets out, looks around, unlocks the shack and 
               starts to load full gas-cans into the back of the truck.

                                                                  INTERCUT:

               A single, small lamp. Shelly, in robe and nightgown, moves 
               into the kitchen, looks out the window at Leo (off-screen). 
               Takes the gun from the table, puts it in her pocket, lights 
               a cigarette.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               LEO

               Secures the tarp back over the gas cans and moves towards 
               the house when he's slugged from behind in the kidneys. He 
               grunts and goes down on one knee.

               A SHADOWY ASSAILANT efficiently, silently and systematically 
               dismantles him, finally turning him and hitting him with 
               three hard right hands to the face. Dazed and bleeding, Leo 
               never knew what hit him. The Assailant grabs Leo by the lapels 
               and pulls him close. The Assailant is Hank Jennings.

                                     HANK
                         You were supposed to mind the store 
                         while I was gone, not open your own 
                         franchise--

               A short punch, then...

                                     HANK
                         Do as you're told, Leo. Next time 
                         you'll watch me take your little 
                         chippie apart before I kill you.

               Hank lets him go and disappears.

               Shelly, who hasn't heard a thing, finishes her cigarette. 
               Suddenly, Leo bursts in the door behind her, staggering to 
               the sink. turns on the water, his face a bloody mess...

                                     LEO

                              (lashing out)
                         Just call the damn doctor, do as 
                         you're told!

               He backhands her, sends her sprawling. She lands hard. Takes 
               the gun from her pocket.

                                     LEO

                         me?

                                     SHELLY

                         Besides, you haven't got the guts--

               Shelly closes her eyes and fires. Leo yells, falls back, 
               knocking the lamp off the table. Darkness. Screaming. The 
               front door slams open and shut, the screaming moves outside.

               Shelly huddles in a corner, clutching the gun, terrified. We 
               hear the pick-up truck start and drive off. Shelly tries to 
               catch her breath.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Dale Cooper rounds the corner, takes out his room key. He 
               stops, listens to the sounds of the still raucous Icelandic 
               party going on downstairs. Cooper sadly shakes his head, 
               starts to unlock his door and realizes it's open. He draws 
               his gun.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The door stands open, light coming in from the corridor. 
               Cooper enters a moment later, with his weapon drawn. He slowly 
               closes the door, moves in, keeping the gun trained on the 
               bed.

                                     COOPER
                         Reach over slowly and turn on the 
                         bedside lamp.

               There's someone in the bed. The person turns on the lamp. 
               Audrey. Naked under the sheets, eyes red with tears.

                                     AUDREY
                         Don't make me leave. Please don't 
                         make me leave.

               Cooper slowly lowers his weapon.

                                                              CUT TO BLACK:
