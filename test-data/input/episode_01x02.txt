                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HORNE RESIDENCE WING - EVENING

               JERRY HORNE sits before a roaring fireplace, tumbler of 
               bourbon in hand, eating nuts compulsively from a giant bowl 
               while rapidly adding figures on a large computer while scores 
               of numbers flash up and down on the large computer monitor, 
               all the while talking into a headset phone receiver in a 
               melange of Icelandic and English.

               In another part of the spacious room, the Horne family sits 
               quietly around the dinner table. AUDREY HORNE plays listlessly 
               with her food. A NURSE helps JOHNNY-still-wearing-his-
               headdress-HORNE eat, while MRS. HORNE stares at her full 
               plate. For no discernable reason, Johnny bursts into tears. 
               The Nurse comforts him and he starts to eat again. In spite 
               of her feigned indifference, a small, sad tear slips down 
               Audrey's cheek as she watches her brother.

               BENJAMIN HORNE finishes carving up and chewing a big rare 
               steak and looks around at his family. He puts his napkin on 
               the table, rises, then smiles.

                                     BENJAMIN
                         Always a pleasure.
                              (calls to his brother)
                         Power down, Jer. We've got a 
                         "meeting."

               Jerry gets up, switches off the computer and does an Indian 
               dance towards and eventually around the dinner table, making 
               "traditional" Indian noises.

                                     JERRY
                              (his idea of being a 
                              funny guy)
                         Nephew Johnny, don't be forlorn... 
                         things're bound to get better in the 
                         morn... then there's Sylvia, who 
                         treats me with scorn... she thinks 
                         Jerry an absolute thorn...

               He kisses her; Jerry repulses her. Jerry indian dances toward 
               Audrey. Johnny breaks down again.

                                     JERRY
                         ...around the horn to little niece 
                         Audrey, the Horne's first born...
                              (Audrey's amused)
                         ...and here goes Jerry with brother 
                         Ben Horne, long-gone like turkeys 
                         through the corn...

               Ben and Jerry exit.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BLACK LAKE - NIGHT

               A full moon in a dark sky illuminates the cold, placid surface 
               of Black Lake.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. HORNE CRUISER - NIGHT

               A 1942, solid mahogany 22 foot Fitzgerald and Lee custom 
               streamliner runabout cuts through the water. Benjamin Horne 
               is at the wheel, his brother Jerry Horne beside him, spotting 
               ahead of them through infra-red, night-vision binoculars.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THEIR POV - BINOCULAR EFFECT

               Bright lights on a long peninsula, their destination.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. DOCK - NIGHT

               The boat glides up slowly to the dock. Jerry tosses a line 
               to a gorgeous young female deckhand, SWABBIE, dressed in a 
               skimpy, stylized, sailor's uniform. Swabbie ties off the 
               boat as a SECURITY GUARD, also dressed in a nautically themed 
               uniform, stands by, watching.

                                     JERRY
                         Permission to come ashore?

                                     SWABBIE
                         Permission granted.

               Jerry gives Swabbie a kiss. Benjamin follows Jerry out of 
               the boat onto the dock.

                                     BENJAMIN
                         Hey, Sailor.

                                     SWABBIE
                         Good evening, Mr. Horne.

               Benjamin tips her a ten-spot and rubs her elbow.

                                     SWABBIE
                         Thank you, Mr. Horne.

               Ben and Jerry start up a flight of stairs to the brightly 
               lit structure above. Swabbie picks up a phone on a piling 
               and pushes a button.

                                     SWABBIE
                         Horne brothers, comin' up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ONE-EYED JACKS - NIGHT

               A large sign of a playing card, a one-eyed jack, with neon 
               flashing "J's" and one pulsating eye, is suspended over two 
               identical doors. On one of the doors is a small neon sign 
               that reads, "CASINO." Ben and Jerry come up to the doors and 
               stop.

                                     JERRY
                         Now, are we gonna go into the casino 
                         first?

                                     BENJAMIN
                         I'm not here to lose my shirt, I 
                         just want to take it off.

               Jerry rings a bell on the door without the sign. An electronic 
               buzz, a latch gives, and the door swings open.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ONE-EYED JACKS "LET'S GET ACQUAINTED" ROOM - NIGHT

               Ben and Jerry enter a plush, cozy warmly lit room, easy 
               chairs, fluffy sofas and a small bar with a brass rail. Jerry 
               orders drinks from a scantily clad female BARTENDER.

                                     JERRY
                         Sweetheart, I'd like to order two 
                         drinks, one double scotch on the 
                         rocks and my brother will have a 
                         double scotch on the rocks.
                              (winks)

                                     BARTENDER
                         That's two double scotch on the rocks?

                                     JERRY
                         Next stop, rocket science.

               Several of the establishment's sensational and extraordinary 
               WORKING GIRLS, known collectively as "The 52 Pick-Ups," enter 
               the room. They sit and luxuriously arrange themselves. Ben 
               and Jerry take note as they pick up their drinks. In sweeps 
               BLACKIE "THE BLACK ROSE" O'REILLY, the Madam of the House, 
               an intelligent, strikingly attractive woman in her mid-
               thirties.

                                     BLACKIE
                         Gentlemen...

                                     BENJAMIN
                         Blackie...
                              (he kisses her hand)
                         "Shall I compare thee to a summer's 
                         day? Thou art more lovely and more 
                         temperate: Rough winds do not shake 
                         the darling buds of May, And summer's 
                         lease hath all too short a date: 
                         Sometimes too hot the eye of heaven 
                         shines, And often is his gold 
                         complexion dimm'd; And every fair 
                         from fair sometimes declines, By 
                         chance or nature's changing course 
                         untrimm'd; But thy eternal summer 
                         shall not fade, Nor lose possession 
                         of that fair thou ow'st, Nor shall 
                         death brag thou wander'st in his 
                         shade, When in eternal lines to time 
                         thou grow'st; So long as man can 
                         breathe, or eyes can see, So long 
                         live this, and this gives life to 
                         thee."

               During above we register Blackie's reaction, detached 
               amusement, and Jerry's reaction, bored indifference. Several 
               more Pick-Ups wander in and we pay attention to their 
               reactions and those of the others already in the room, who 
               see Benjamin an ideal of worldly sophistication and power.

               Benjamin finishes and kisses Blackie's hand again. Jerry 
               comes up to her and says quietly.

                                     JERRY
                         Which one's the new girl?

                                     BLACKIE
                         When you really want love... you 
                         will find it waiting for you.

               A curtain opens, revealing a gorgeous young WOMAN with the 
               face of an angel. Ben and Jerry look at each other, then 
               instantly back to the Woman. Jerry takes a coin out of his 
               pocket, flips it, and covers his wrist.

               Jerry and Ben look down at the coin: heads. Ben smiles, pats 
               his brother on the back, and starts towards the Woman. Jerry 
               slaps the coin down on the bar.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A TAPE RECORDER

               A tape playing in the small recorder comes to an end and the 
               "play" button pops back out. We see that the tape is labeled, 
               "TO DR. JACOBY WITH LOVE, LAURA."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DR. JACOBY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Deeply saddened, Dr. Jacoby finishes listening to the tape, 
               removes the headphones, takes the tape out of the recorder. 
               He moves to the artificial palm tree near the wall and removes 
               one of the coconuts from a branch of the tree.

               Jacoby snaps open the coconut, which is actually a stash box 
               disguised as a coconut, slips the tape inside, snaps it shut, 
               and attaches it back to the tree.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HAYWARD HOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Dr. and Mrs. Hayward are clearing away pie plates from the 
               coffee table in front of a fire burning in the fireplace. 
               Donna and James are sitting on opposite ends of the sofa.

                                     JAMES
                         That was great huckleberry pie, Mrs. 
                         Hayward.

                                     EILEEN
                         You only had three pieces, James, 
                         are you sure you wouldn't like 
                         another?

                                     JAMES
                         No thank you, ma'am.

                                     DR. HAYWARD
                         How 'bout some more coffee?

                                     JAMES
                         No thank you, sir.

                                     DONNA
                              (a semi-subtle signal)
                         Dad...

                                     DR. HAYWARD
                              (gets it)
                         Mrs. Hayward and I are going to say 
                         goodnight to you now, James.

                                     EILEEN
                         Good night, James.

                                     DONNA
                         Just leave the dishes, Mom, I'll 
                         clean up.

                                     EILEEN
                         Thank you, dear, good night.

               Mrs. Hayward steers herself into the kitchen.

                                     DR. HAYWARD
                         Will you be joining us for church 
                         tomorrow, Donna?

                                     DONNA
                         Yes.

                                     DR. HAYWARD
                         Nine o'clock sharp.

               He winks and exits. Donna and James are alone. From another 
               room we hear the sound of an engine start up and whine. James 
               looks at Donna.

                         Elevator.

               James nods. A slightly awkward but not uncomfortable silence. 
               He tentatively reaches over for her hand, she takes it. They 
               hold hands and look at each other. He slowly pulls her towards 
               him into a sweet, tender kiss. They look at each other. She 
               smiles. They kiss again, very passionately.

                                     DONNA
                              (whispers)
                         I can't stop thinking about you...

                                     JAMES
                              (touches her cheek)
                         I've thought about you all day...

                                     DONNA
                         I keep thinking of Laura, too.

                                     JAMES
                         Yeah...

                                     DONNA
                         What are we gonna do?

                                     JAMES
                         Donna, I don't feel that what we're 
                         doing is wrong, or what we're feeling--

                                     DONNA
                         Why not?

                                     JAMES
                         Because it's the truth. Because I 
                         think it would have turned out this 
                         way sooner or later anyway--

                                     DONNA
                         I don't know--you do?

                                     JAMES
                         Yes. I remember a time in school, 
                         remember, in the hall, we were 
                         suddenly alone and we looked at each 
                         other--

                                     DONNA
                         I remember--

                                     JAMES
                         I almost told you I loved you then.

                                     DONNA
                         It's true.

                                     JAMES
                         It's true, isn't it?

                                     DONNA
                         I guess because of Laura, I couldn't 
                         say anything, I couldn't even let 
                         myself think about it--

                                     JAMES
                         Me too.

                                     DONNA
                              (tender and trembling)
                         Are we...
                              (moves closer to him)
                         ...are we... going to be together?

               He kisses her. She kisses him. They kiss.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The door flies open. Long pause. DALE COOPER takes one step 
               into view, looks into the room, realizes it's safe, then 
               enters. He plays a little birdcall on his handcarved whittle 
               whistle. He sees the red message light blinking on his bedside 
               phone.

               Cooper dials the operator.

                         Deputy Hill, this is Agent Cooper...

                                                                  INTERCUT:

                         Just thought I should let you know 
                         everything's quiet here at the 
                         hospital...

                         How's Ronette Pulaski?

                                     HAWK
                         Body and spirit are still far apart.

                                     COOPER
                         What did you find out from her 
                         parents?

                                     HAWK
                         Little. Ronette recently quit her 
                         job at the perfume counter of Horne's 
                         department store.

                                     COOPER
                         Is that Benjamin Horne?

                                     HAWK
                         Yes, sir, family business. Everything 
                         else is good except that at ten 
                         o'clock there was a one-armed man 
                         snooping around intensive care.

               As they speak, Cooper looks over and sees a note being slipped 
               under his hotel room door.

                                     COOPER
                         One-armed man?

                                     HAWK
                         Left.

                                     COOPER
                         Did you question him?

                                     HAWK
                         Negative. I pursued, but he got away.

                                     COOPER
                         Alright. Maintain a watch on Ronette 
                         around the clock and we'll talk 
                         tomorrow.

               STAY with Cooper as he hangs up, rises, and moves to the 
               note. He picks it up, opens it and reads...

                          "HAVE YOU LOOKED INTO ONE-EYED JACKS?"

               Cooper sniffs the note and smiles.

               INT. MARTELL BEDROOM - NIGHT

               PETE MARTELL and his wife CATHERINE are uneasily coexisting 
               in a heavy silence. Pete sits on the edge of the bed, rubbing 
               some mink oil into his boots. Catherine folds some laundry 
               and puts it away in a chest of drawers. She sniffs.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Everything smells like fish around 
                         here.

                                     PETE
                         Then why don't you wash your socks 
                         separately?

                                     CATHERINE
                         Why don't you drive your truck into 
                         a tree?

                                     PETE
                              (smiles)
                         I got an idea: tomorrow's Sunday, 
                         let's stay up late tonight and bicker.

               Catherine takes some laundry into a large walk-in closet and 
               puts the clothes away. Pete quietly rises, silently picks up 
               a small vase from the dresser, dumps the contents into his 
               hand and takes out a small key with a tag.

                                     CATHERINE
                              (from the closet)
                         What was that FBI man doing up here 
                         today?

                                     PETE
                         Nice fella. Asked a few questions.

                                     CATHERINE
                         About what?

                                     PETE
                         He talked to Josie mostly. I had a 
                         problem with a fish took a likin' to 
                         my percolator.

                                     CATHERINE
                         What did he talk to Josie about?

                                     PETE
                         Why don't you ask her?

               Pete sits down with the key in his pocket as Catherine re-
               enters.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Did they talk about my brother at 
                         all?

                                     PETE
                         Andrew?

                                     CATHERINE
                         How many brothers do I have?

                                     PETE
                         I heard them mention him. The 
                         accident.

                                     CATHERINE
                         What about the accident?

                                     PETE
                         You know, the usual, how no one found 
                         his body. Mostly they talked about 
                         Laura. How she was up here the 
                         afternoon of the day she died.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Didn't he want to talk to us?

                                     PETE
                         I talked to him. Real nice fella.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Did he express any interest in talking 
                         to me?

                                     PETE
                         Yeah, but we told him you were on 
                         your world tour, he should contact 
                         your press agent.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Take your boots off my bed and go to 
                         your room.

                                     PETE
                         Didn't want to get mink oil on my 
                         bedspread.

               Pete rises and exits, whistling.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BLUE PINE LODGE CORRIDOR/JOSIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Pete wanders down the hall, taps on a door. JOSIE PACKARD 
               opens the door. Pete holds up the small key.

                                     PETE
                              (whispers)
                         Don't use it til tomorrow. I'll get 
                         her out of the house.

                                     JOSIE
                         Thanks, Pete.

                                     PETE
                         You bet'cha.

               She takes the key and goes back inside. Pete moves on, 
               whistling. In her room, Josie opens a small rectangular 
               lacquer box.  She presses the key into the hard clay inside 
               the box, making an impression of the key. She then removes 
               the key and closes the box.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PALMER HOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Feet pace restlessly back and forth across the carpet. LELAND 
               PALMER moves to the record player. A record drops on the 
               turntable. Big band music. Leland listens, sways, tries to 
               get the feel of the music. Decides it isn't right, not up 
               tempo enough.

               Leland lifts the stylus and drops the needle on another part 
               of the record, searching frantically for a particular song, 
               which he finally locates.

               Big band again, but fast, loud and brassy. He listens again. 
               This time it's the right stuff; tears spring into his eyes.  
               He looks across at Laura's picture on the table. He starts 
               to dance, in torment of anger, sadness and nostalgic despair, 
               jitterbugging back and forth in front of the picture.

               He makes a loud moaning, wailing sound.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PALMER HOUSE CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               Startled by the sound and the music from downstairs, SARAH 
               PALMER peeks her head around the corner of the corridor at 
               the top of the stairs.

               She starts quickly down the stairs and moves towards the 
               living room...

                                                                  INTERCUT:

               SARAH'S POV

               As the living room comes into view and she sees her husband 
               dancing.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PALMER LIVING ROOM  - NIGHT

               Sarah enters the room where Leland is dancing and wailing.

                                     SARAH
                              (frightened)
                         Leland?... Leland?...

               He looks at her, goes right over her and grabs her.

                                     LELAND
                         Sarah, we have to dance...

               He tries to move her, trying desperately to dance with her.

                                     SARAH
                         Leland, stop, stop it--

                                     LELAND
                         Sarah, we have to dance--we have to 
                         dance--

                                     SARAH
                         Leland, Leland--

                                     LELAND
                         We have to dance--for Laura!

               She starts screaming, he starts moaning and moving her around 
               in front of the fireplace. We MOVE in on the fire.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                       END ACT ONE

                                         ACT TWO

               FADE IN:

               EXT. TWIN PEAKS SHERIFF STATION - DAY

               Establish.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. REAR OF SHERIFF STATION - DAY

               A large blackboard is set up behind the station. Special 
               Agent Dale Cooper is writing a list on the blackboard with 
               chalk, consulting his electronic notebook. A small table is 
               set up near the blackboard, covered with the fruits of Lucy's 
               morning doughnut run. Four folding chairs are set up near 
               the table.

               Sheriff HARRY S. TRUMAN is using a tape measure to calculate 
               the distance from a line drawn on the ground in front of the 
               blackboard to a large nearby rock.

               LUCY MORAN is holding the end of the tape measure on the 
               line, eating a donut. Deputy Hawk is placing an empty pop 
               bottle on a marked flat spot on top of the rock. Deputy ANDY 
               BRENNAN is gathering small, round rocks into a galvanized 
               metal bucket. They all carry mugs of coffee that read, "Twin 
               Peaks Sheriff's Department."

                                     COOPER
                              (thinks of something, 
                              flips on recorder)
                         Diane, 8:17, quick note: definition 
                         of a Chinese word, "Koro," that's 
                         the name of Mrs. Josie Packard's 
                         dog, mixed breed. I believe the word 
                         is Mandarin, I'm sure I know what it 
                         means but I can't lay my hands on 
                         it.

               Truman reaches the spot on the rock with the tape and calls 
               back...

                                     TRUMAN
                         Exactly sixty feet, six inches.

                                     COOPER
                         Perfect.

               Cooper bites into a doughnut. At the rock, Hawk whispers to 
               the Sheriff...

                                     HAWK
                         What do you think he's up to?

                                     TRUMAN
                         Beats me.

                                     HAWK
                         Sixty feet, six inches; that's the 
                         distance from home plate to the 
                         pitcher's mound.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Kinda interesting, huh?

                                     HAWK
                         Yeah.

               Truman starts back, re-spooling the tape measure. Andy shows 
               Cooper the bucket of rocks.

                                     ANDY
                         Where would you like these rocks?

                                     COOPER
                         Set 'em down by the donuts, Deputy.

               Andy does. Lucy picks up a coffee pot.

                                     LUCY
                         Would anyone like a warm-up?

                                     EVERYONE
                              (severally)
                         Yes, please... thanks... you bet...

                                     COOPER
                         Damn good coffee.
                              (sips, burns his tongue)
                         ...and hot. Would everyone please 
                         take a seat?

               Truman, Hawk, Andy and Lucy sit on the four folding chairs. 
               Cooper takes a telescoping pointer out of his coat pocket 
               and expands it full length.

                                     COOPER
                         By way of explaining what we've been 
                         doing and are about to do, I'm going 
                         to first talk to you a little bit 
                         about the country called Tibet.

               Cooper flips the two-sided blackboard over, revealing a 
               detailed map of Tibet and surrounding countries tacked to 
               the back.

                                     COOPER
                         Tibet is bordered on the southeast 
                         by Burma, on the south by India and 
                         Nepal, on the west by India and 
                         Kashmir and on the north and east by 
                         China. It is almost completely 
                         surrounded by mountain ranges. An 
                         extremely spiritual country, 
                         practicing a form of Buddhism known 
                         as Tibetan Buddhism, for many 
                         centuries the leader of Tibet has 
                         been known as the Dalai Lama; upon 
                         the death of each Dalai Lama, his 
                         spirit is believed to pass into the 
                         body of a newborn infant. An exacting 
                         series of test are performed to 
                         discover this boy's identity, who is 
                         then rigorously trained to fulfill 
                         his great responsibilities.

               The Sheriff's Department is intrigued, but completely 
               mystified.

                                     COOPER
                         In 1950, Communist China invaded 
                         Tibet and while leaving the Dalai 
                         Lama nominally in charge, they in 
                         fact seized control of the entire 
                         country. Following a Tibetan uprising 
                         against the Chinese in 1959, the 
                         Dalai Lama was forced to flee for 
                         his life to India, and has lived in 
                         exile ever since.

               Cooper collapses his expanding pointer.

                                     COOPER
                         Following a dream I had three years 
                         ago, I have become deeply moved by 
                         the plight of the Tibetan people, 
                         and have been filled with a desire 
                         to help them.

               Cooper flips the blackboard back over. The Sheriff's 
               Department members look at each other just a tad uneasily.

                                     COOPER
                         I also awoke from this dream realizing 
                         that I had subconsciously gained 
                         knowledge of a certain deductive 
                         technique, involving mind-body 
                         coordination operating hand-in-hand 
                         with the deepest levels of intuition. 
                         Sheriff, Deputy Hawk, if I could 
                         have your assistance I will be happy 
                         to demonstrate this technique...

               Truman and Hawk look at the other, look at each other, and 
               stand. Cooper expands his pointer again.

                                     COOPER
                         You'll recall that on the day of her 
                         death, Laura Palmer wrote in her 
                         diary the following entry...

               Points to where this line is written along the top left side 
               of the blackboard...

                                     COOPER
                         "Nervous about meeting "J." tonight." 
                         Remember also that under the nail on 
                         the ring finger of Laura's left hand 
                         we discovered the letter...

               Points to where this is written on the top right side of the 
               blackboard.

                                     COOPER
                         "R." In addition, under the nail on 
                         the ring finger of the left hand of 
                         Theresa Banks, the girl who was 
                         murdered last year, we discovered 
                         the letter "T."

               He writes the letter "T" next to the "R."

                                     COOPER
                         Today, however, we are going to 
                         concentrate on the "J's." Harry, if 
                         you would, when I give the word, 
                         would you please read aloud each of 
                         the names we've written on the 
                         blackboard, all of whom had a direct 
                         connection with Laura Palmer.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Okay... alright.

                                     COOPER
                         Deputy Hawk, if you would hold this 
                         bucket of rocks up near me where I 
                         can get at them... and would you 
                         please wear kitchen mittens.

                                     HAWK
                              (looks at Truman, who 
                              nods)
                         Yes, sir.

               Hawk puts on a pair of kitchen mittens and picks up the bucket 
               of rocks.

                                     COOPER
                         Deputy Andy, would you please move 
                         down near the bottle and stand by--

               Andy rises and runs towards the distant rock, only too happy 
               to help.

                                     COOPER
                              (calling out)
                         Not too near!

               Andy waves.

                                     COOPER
                         Lucy, would you please take the chalk?

                                     LUCY
                              (rises, takes the 
                              chalk from Cooper)
                         I'm getting excited.

                                     COOPER
                         And if I hit the bottle after Sheriff 
                         Truman calls out a particular name, 
                         make a check on the board to the 
                         right of that name--Sheriff, I almost 
                         forgot, when you say the name, also 
                         briefly describe, if known, the 
                         person's relationship to Laura Palmer--
                         ready?

                                     EVERYONE
                              (severally)
                         All set... yes... yep...

                                     ANDY
                         Ready!

               Cooper nods to Hawk, who holds up the bucket, then nods to 
               Truman.

                                     TRUMAN
                         James Hurley...
                              (searches for a 
                              description)
                         ...secret boyfriend.

               Cooper picks out a rock and holds it. He closes his eyes.

                                     COOPER
                         James Hurley.

               Cooper opens his eyes, winds up, and hurls the rock towards 
               the bottle. It strikes the larger rock well below the bottle.  
               Cooper nods at Truman.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Josie Packard... was instructed in 
                         English by Laura.

               Cooper picks up a rock, closes his eyes.

                                     COOPER
                         Josie Packard.

               Cooper opens his eyes and lets it fly. It sails way above 
               the bottle, hits a tree and startles a bird that takes flight.

                                     LUCY
                         So there's no check next to either 
                         name?

                                     COOPER
                         That's correct--next name, Sheriff.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Dr. Lawrence Jacoby... Laura's 
                         psychiatrist.

               Cooper repeats the rock routine.

                                     COOPER
                         Dr. Lawrence Jacoby.

               Cooper throws again and hits the bottle. It falls off the 
               rock but doesn't break.

                                     LUCY
                         You did it, you hit it.

               Lucy writes a check next to Jacoby's name.

                                     COOPER
                         Lucy, make a note that the bottle 
                         was struck but did not break--very 
                         important--Andy, put the bottle back 
                         in exactly the same spot.

               Lucy and Andy follow directions. Cooper nods to Truman.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Johnny Horne... Laura was his special 
                         education tutor.

                                     COOPER
                         Johnny Horne.

               He throws and clanks a fifty-gallon trash can, under a Douglas 
               Fir.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Norma Jennings... owns diner, helped 
                         Laura organize the Meals on Wheels 
                         charity program.

                                     COOPER
                         Norma Jennings.

               He throws and misses.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Shelly Johnson... waitress at diner, 
                         friend.

                                     COOPER
                         Shelly Johnson.

               Cooper throws it again; it ricochets off the large rock, 
               shoots up and wings Andy in the loaf.

                                     COOPER
                         Andy, I'm sorry --

                                     LUCY
                         Sweetie?

                                     ANDY
                              (immediately reassuring)
                         It didn't hurt, honest, it didn't 
                         hurt a bit.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Where there's no sense, there's no 
                         feeling.

               They all laugh, including Andy.

                                     COOPER
                         Sheriff, please continue.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Joey Paulson... friend of James, 
                         drove Donna to meet him.

                                     COOPER
                         Joey Paulson.

               Cooper opens his eyes, takes aim, throws, and misses. Lucy 
               takes a loud sip of coffee. Cooper nods to Truman again, who 
               is slightly confused by the next name on the blackboard.

                                     TRUMAN
                              (doesn't know who 
                              this is)

                                     COOPER
                         Jack with One Eye...

                                     LUCY
                         There's no "i" in Jack.

                                     COOPER
                         I think perhaps it means he only has 
                         one eye.
                              (covers an eye)

                         wife.

                         No, there's a casino up north called 
                         One-Eyed Jack's.

                                     COOPER

                         It's across the border on the Canadian 
                         side.

                                     COOPER
                         Sheriff, we're gonna have to check 
                         that place out.

                                     TRUMAN

                         Agent Cooper, I'm going to erase 
                         this because it's a place, not a 
                         person--

                                     COOPER
                         Fine. Next name.

                         husband of Shelly, drives a truck, 
                         connection to Laura... unknown.

               He throws the rock, hits the bottle and breaks it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               NORMA JENNINGS is on the phone back in the kitchen.

                         Shelly? It's Norma.

                                     SHELLY
                              (trying to sound normal)
                         Oh hi, Norma, I was just about to 
                         call you --

                                     NORMA
                         Are you alright?

                                     SHELLY
                         I'm fine, I'm fine, actually, I'm 
                         not feeling to good, think I got a 
                         touch of the flu--

                                     NORMA
                         Shelly, didn't you have the flu last 
                         week?

                                     SHELLY
                         Norma, I'm okay... I just... can't 
                         come in today.

                                     NORMA
                         I'm worried about you.

                                     SHELLY
                         Thank you, Norma, I'll be fine, I 
                         just need to rest.

                                     NORMA
                         You want me to bring you anything?

                                     SHELLY
                         No, no, I've got everything here I 
                         need, but thanks anyway, I hope you'll 
                         be okay down there. Heidi should be 
                         able to work my shift, she shouldn't 
                         mind too much, I know she needs the 
                         money--

                                     NORMA
                         Shelly, don't worry about it, you 
                         work on getting better--

                                     SHELLY
                         Norma, I know you always feel like 
                         you have to drop by, but don't drop 
                         by, I'm okay...
                              (she starts to get 
                              tearful, hides it)
                         I'll see you later.

               Shelly hangs up. Norma hangs up slowly and takes a sip from 
               a cup of coffee, thinking about Shelly. She turns to a small 
               television set on the counter behind her and turns up the 
               volume.

               We MOVE in on the television screen in time to see...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CLOSE on the set, as lush MUSIC swells over a robin's egg 
               blue background and we hear...

               A beautiful, glowing white envelope is set down on the 
               background and a silk ribbon is effortlessly untied... a 
               folded white note is taken from the envelope...

               An establishing shot on the soap opera, a sign strung between 
               two towering Ponderosa pines that reads:

                                       "THE PINES"

               CAMERA pans down to a smaller sign that reads:

               INT. "INVITATION TO LOVE" SET #1 - "NIGHT"

               A fake-classy elegant generic living room-dining room. A 
               beautiful, naughty looking redhead, EMERALD, bursts into the 
               room, steaming. She paces, picks up a silver cigarette box, 
               takes out a smoke, taps it angrily on the box and fires it 
               up with a two pound acrylic-glass-sculpture lighter. She 
               exhales an exasperated burst of smoke.

               A nice-good-looking-but-ineffectual young man, CHET, follows 
               her into the room, carrying a highball.

                                     CHET

                         Yes, but those pains were real. You 
                         shouldn't have spoken that way to 
                         Melanie, she was with him at the 
                         hospital night and day, she was 
                         exhausted when you spoke, she didn't

               They both look towards a pair of open French doors leading

               Commercial music in; Nadine, in workout gear, resumes 
               vigorously rowing on her rowing machine. Wearing an extremely 
               greasy gas station work shirt, his hands covered with 
               industrial strength grime, BIG ED HURLEY enters the front 
               door behind her, stops when he sees Nadine rowing away.

               Ed tries to tiptoe around behind Nadine so she doesn't see 
               him and in doing so steps on a drape runner and a bag of 
               cotton balls laid out on the floor. He bends the drape runner. 
               Nadine stops rowing.

                         You think that's an accident? I laid 
                         it out there myself, I was up all 
                         night working on that invention--I'm 
                         going to have the world's first 100%

               Ed nods and moves into the other room. Pumped up with rage, 
               Nadine re-grips the metal oars and pulls back on them; we 
               hear the screech of rending steel as the oars bend back like 
               willow sticks.

               She decides to partially open the door and speak to him, 
               keeping the bruised side of her face hidden.

               Catherine's office. Leaving the door open, Josie moves behind 
               the desk. She searches for and finds a catch that releases a 
               latch...

               ...a false shelf of books hinge out from the wall, revealing 
               an old fashioned wall safe. Josie takes out the key that 
               Pete gave her and inserts it into the keyhole of the safe. 
               She manipulates the handle and opens the safe door.

               Josie reaches into the safe and lifts out two sets of two 
               ledger books labeled: PACKARD SAWMILL, RECEIPTS; one set 
               labeled "1989" and the other "1990."

               Josie hears a car drive up and brakes squeal outside.

               Josie quickly puts the books back in the safe, closes the 
               safe, replaces the false bookshelf, and scurries out of the 
               room.

               Just as Josie enters the corridor, Catherine comes up the

                         in the car.

               Catherine moves to the desk, looking for something, which 
               she finds. Josie watches from the closet as Catherine 
               remembers something, picks up a phone, punches in a number 
               on the auto-dialer and waits.

                         Ben, Catherine... where the hell 
                         were you last night? I thought we 
                         had a date... family crisis? You 
                         want to see a family crisis, try

               She hangs up and exits. In the closet, waiting, Josie ponders 
               this information.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CHURCH - CLOSER - DAY

               Doc Hayward pushes Mrs. Hayward in her wheelchair towards 
               the handicapped access ramp. Donna exits the church behind 
               them and sees Audrey Horne is standing outside, leaning 
               against a railing.

                                     AUDREY
                              (to Donna)
                         Hi.

                                     DONNA
                         Hi.

               Something in Audrey's look says she wants to talk to Donna.

                                     DONNA
                         I'll be right there, Dad.

                                     DR. HAYWARD
                         We're going over to get a Softie 
                         Freeze, you'll be joining us, won't 
                         you?

                                     DONNA
                         Dad, when I have ever missed a Softie 
                         Freeze?

                                     MRS. HAYWARD
                         Maybe Audrey would like to join us?

                                     AUDREY
                         Do you all go for a Softie Freeze 
                         every Sunday?

                                     DR. HAYWARD
                         Every Sunday after church since Donna 
                         was a little girl.

                                     MRS. HAYWARD
                         We enjoy is so much. Hope you can 
                         join us.

               Mrs. Hayward drives down the ramp.

                                     DR. HAYWARD
                         Nice to see you in church, Audrey.

               Dr. Hayward follows his wife off.

                                     AUDREY
                              (sincerely)
                         I wanted to come down cause of Laura.

                                     DONNA
                         What do you mean? I didn't think you 
                         even liked her.

                                     AUDREY
                         There were things about her I didn't 
                         like, but she helped take care of my 
                         brother. And I guess I sort of loved 
                         her for that. That's why I'm here.

                                     DONNA
                         That's really nice of you.

                                     AUDREY
                         I knew how close you were to her. I 
                         wanted to tell you how sorry I am.

                                     DONNA
                         Thanks.

               Audrey nods, shyly, ready to move off.

                                     AUDREY
                         You take care.

               Donna starts to watch her go.

                                     DONNA
                              (feeling Audrey's 
                              loneliness)
                         Why don't you come with us for a 
                         Softie Freeze?

                                     AUDREY
                         I don't know...

                                     DONNA
                         Really.

                                     AUDREY
                              (touched)
                         Yeah?

                                     DONNA
                         Sure, come on, they're really good.

                                     AUDREY
                         Okay.

                                     DONNA
                         And if we're really lucky, maybe my 
                         dad will tell his story about the 
                         night the porcupine got into the 
                         hospital.

                                     AUDREY
                         Oh, I'd like to hear about that.

               They walk off together towards the parking lot.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION RECEPTION AREA - DAY

               Three men in black suits, hats and sunglasses enter the 
               building, each carrying a stainless steel suitcase. The point 
               man is ALBERT ROSENFIELD, a brilliant, mannerless FBI 
               forensics expert, the others are his ASSISTANTS. Lucy looks 
               up from behind the reception window.

                                     ALBERT
                              (abruptly)
                         Tell Agent Cooper that Albert and 
                         his team are here.

                                     LUCY
                         Albert?

                                     ALBERT
                         Are we going to have to stand here 
                         all afternoon?

                                     LUCY
                         No.

                                     ALBERT
                         Albert. Albert Rosenfield. Ro-sen-
                         field.

                                     LUCY
                              (punches into the 
                              switchboard)
                         Sheriff, this is Lucy, is Agent Cooper 
                         with you?

                                     TRUMAN'S VOICE
                              (over the speaker)
                         Yes--

                                     COOPER'S VOICE
                              (over the speaker)
                         Is Albert here, Lucy?

                                     LUCY
                              (surprised)
                         Yes, he is.

                                     COOPER'S VOICE
                         We're on our way.

                              (to Albert)

                              (takes out a cigarette)
                         I can hear perfectly well.

               One of his Associates lights his cigarette. None of them see 
               Lucy stick out her tongue at Albert.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               As Cooper and Truman move towards the reception area.

                                     COOPER
                         Harry, just so you know, Albert and 
                         his team are the cream of the crop--

                                     TRUMAN
                         If they're working for you, I wouldn't 
                         expect anything less.

                                     COOPER
                         Albert's a forensics genius, but I 
                         should warn you he's lacking in some 
                         of the social niceties.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Nobody's perfect.

                                     COOPER
                         Isn't that the truth?

               They turn a corner and come upon Albert and his team.

                                     ALBERT
                         What the hell kind of a two-bit 
                         operation are they running out of 
                         this tree house, Agent Cooper?

                                     COOPER
                         Albert, this is Sheriff Truman.

                                     ALBERT
                         I have seen some slipshod backwater 
                         burgs in my time, but this place 
                         takes the cake.

               Truman gives an astonished look at Cooper, who gestures "see 
               what I mean?"

                                     ALBERT
                         What are you waiting for, paint to 
                         dry? We've got work to do, damn it, 
                         they're putting the girl in the ground 
                         tomorrow, half the day's wasted 
                         traveling out here to the middle of 
                         nowhere--

                                     COOPER
                              (keeps his cool; knows 
                              Albert well)
                         Albert, I suggest you and the fellas 
                         go to work.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I'll have one of my men escort you 
                         to the morgue and we'll take one of 
                         your men up to the crime site.

                                     COOPER
                              (hands him a file)
                         Results from the pathologist's 
                         autopsy.

                                     ALBERT
                              (scans it scornfully)
                         Welcome to Amateur Hour.
                              (to his men)
                         Looks like an all-nighter.

               They pick up their suitcases. Truman holds the door open for 
               them.

                                     TRUMAN
                              (as Albert passes)
                         I hear you're good at what you do.

                                     ALBERT
                         Correct.

                                     TRUMAN
                         That's good, because normally if a 
                         stranger came into my station talking 
                         this kind of crap, he'd walk out 
                         wearing his teeth for a charm 
                         bracelet.

               Albert and Truman look eye-to-eye. Albert blinks first, puts 
               on his shades, and heads out. His men follow. Truman looks 
               at Cooper, who winks at him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Norma's brewing a new pot of coffee, when Ed Hurley walks in 
               and takes a seat at the counter. With a fair number of other 
               customers scattered about, Ed and Norma interact discreetly 
               as she pours him a cup of coffee.

                         Got an appointment with Hank's parole 
                         officer in the morning.

                                     ED
                         What's that all about?

                                     NORMA
                         Don't know. Guess I'll find out.

                                     ED
                         When Hank's hearing?

                                     NORMA
                         Tuesday.

               They not to show their fear to each other. A CUSTOMER sits 
               down at the counter next to Ed. Norma hands him a menu and 
               moves away. Ed rises, put a buck on the counter, gives a 
               Norma a thumbs up as he heads out.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ED HURLEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Ed enters, quietly, moves into the living room. He stops 
               when he hears moans and cries of exertion coming from another 
               room; it sounds like someone's making love.

               Ed moves to the doorway, slowly opens the door...

               ...and discovers the cries are Nadine's, who's doing bench 
               presses on a weight bench with what looks like an enormous 
               amount of weight.

               Ed moves away from the door.

                                     NADINE'S VOICE
                         Ed? That you?

                                     ED
                         It's me.

               We hear the sound of the huge weight clang to the floor and 
               Nadine hurries into the room, flushed with excitement.

                                     NADINE
                         Ed... Ed, I'm so happy, sweetheart, 
                         I have to thank you.

               She embraces him, hugs him alarmingly hard.

                                     ED
                         Why's that?

               She looks up at him, her eyes wide and bright.

                                     NADINE
                         You don't know what you've done for 
                         me.

                                     ED
                         No, I don't.

                                     NADINE
                         Ed, you big lug... when you tracked 
                         all that grease in the house today, 
                         you spilled some onto my cotton balls, 
                         but instead of tossin' 'em out I put 
                         the greased ones on my runners--Ed, 
                         just listen to this...

               She opens and closes the curtains: completely silent runners.

                                     NADINE
                         Completely silent...

                                     ED
                         How 'bout that?

                                     NADINE
                              (tears of joy in her 
                              eye)
                         Ed... we're going to be so rich.

               She embraces him again. Ed pats her back, tries to manufacture 
               a smile.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - NIGHT

               Re-establish. The Sheriff's cruiser pulls up.

               COOPER AND TRUMAN

               As they sit in the cruiser, parting for the night, Cooper 
               consulting his notes, Truman making some of his own.

                                     COOPER
                         Tomorrow we interrogate the trucker

                         We'll see what Albert and his team 
                         have after examining Laura and the 
                         abandoned train car.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Right--funeral's tomorrow.

                                     COOPER
                         Right. No change on the girl at the 
                         hospital, Ronette--

                                     TRUMAN
                         Still in a coma--

                                     COOPER
                         Is it always this temperature at 
                         night?

                                     TRUMAN
                         This time of year.

                                     COOPER
                         This is so pleasant. And the 
                         humidity's so low. In Philadelphia 
                         sometimes you get a heaviness in the 
                         air like wet flannel pajamas.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Why do you think they call it the 
                         "Great Northwest?"

                                     COOPER
                         Harry, you're preaching to the 
                         convinced.

               They shake hands.

                                     COOPER
                         You know where to find me.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Yes, I do.

               Cooper gets out of the car.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL BAR - NIGHT

               Ben and Jerry Horne stand at the bar, nursing tall beers, 
               throwing cashews into the air and catching them in their 
               mouths. Passing by the door, Cooper sees them and enters the 
               bar.

                                     COOPER
                         Mr. Horne?

               Both Ben and Jerry turn towards him.

                         Agent Cooper, I presume.

                         This is my brother Jerry.

                                     JERRY
                              (shakes hands)
                         Happy to make your acquaintance.

                                     COOPER
                         I must say, this is one handsome and 
                         comfortable hotel you have here, 
                         gentlemen.

                                     BENJAMIN
                         Thank you. We aim to please.

                                     COOPER
                         Do you get a lot of the vacation 
                         dollar up this way?

                                     BENJAMIN
                         Yes we do, but of course never as 
                         much as one would like.

                                     JERRY
                         Nothing a large resort wouldn't fix.

                         A large resort. Is that Jerry with a 
                         "J"?

                                     JERRY
                         Yes it is.

                                     COOPER
                         I believe I've met your daughter, 
                         Mr. Horne. What a charming and 
                         attractive girl.

                                     BENJAMIN

                         You must be very proud. Well, I'll 
                         say goodnight. Nice to have met you 
                         both.

                                     BENJAMIN
                         Sleep well.

                         I will. The bed is almost exactly to 
                         the right degree of firmness.

               He's gone. The brothers look at each other: "what is with 
               this guy?"

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. WOODS/INT. CAR - NIGHT

               Bobby Briggs and MIKE NELSON pull up in Bobby's car next to 
               a stand of trees. Bobby kills the engine but the headlights 
               remain on. They look out at the woods.

                                     MIKE
                         I don't see him.

                                     BOBBY
                         He'll be here. Come on, back me up.

               Bobby pops the glove compartment. Mike takes a switchblade 
               out, pockets it. Bobby grabs a flashlight. They step out of 
               the car.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

               Bobby and Mike walk slowly forward, Mike lagging a step or 
               two behind. They reach a particular tree with a large hollow 
               knot. Bobby reaches into the knot and pulls out a football.

                                     MIKE
                         Is it there? It is in there?

               Bobby kneels down and reaches into a slit cut across the top 
               of the hollow football. He pulls out a small packet of white 
               powder.

                                     BOBBY
                         Not all of it.

                         Cash on delivery, Bobby.

               They look up. LEO JOHNSON is standing between them and the 
               car, backlit by headlights, holding a shotgun.

                                     BOBBY
                              (rises slowly)
                         Hey, Leo.

                                     MIKE
                         Hey.

                                     BOBBY
                         It's empty.

               He tosses the football to Leo.

                                     LEO
                         Is that right? Weren't you supposed 
                         to leave something in there for me?

                                     BOBBY
                         That's what we wanted to talk to you 
                         about, man.

                         Half down, half on delivery. That's 
                         the deal.

                                     BOBBY
                         You haven't delivered. We already 
                         gave you half.
                              (holds up the drugs)
                         This is less than you owe us for 
                         that--where's the rest?

                                     LEO
                         Where's the rest of the money?

                                     MIKE
                         There's a problem.

                         Laura had the other half in a safe 
                         deposit box.

                                     BOBBY
                         We can get it, Leo, soon as things 
                         settle down.

                              (backing off)
                         Okay. So we won't take delivery until 
                         we get it for you--

                                     LEO
                         Look at me--I look like a bank to 
                         you?

                                     BOBBY
                         Man, I can appreciate your concern, 
                         but this thing with Laura, how'm I 
                         supposed to anticipate a thing like 
                         that?

                                     LEO
                         Laura was a wild girl.

                                     BOBBY
                         Tell me about it.

                                     LEO
                         Maybe. Someday.

               Leo's right next to Bobby, Mike behind him. Bobby and Mike 
               look at each other. Mike reaches into his pocket. Without 
               taking his eyes off Bobby, Leo slowly swivels the shotgun 
               around and trains it on Mike.

                                     LEO
                         Take your hand out of your pocket, 
                         Mike.

               Mike and Bobby look at each other. Bobby nods. Mike takes 
               his hand out.

                                     BOBBY
                         What's your problem, Leo?

                                     LEO
                         Problem? You want to know about 
                         problems?

                                     BOBBY
                         ...Okay.

                                     LEO
                         You go out on the road. You're 
                         drivin'. Back and forth. Gone for 
                         days. You get home and guess what?

                                     BOBBY
                         What?

                         Yeah?

                                     LEO
                         Yeah. Steppin' out. In your own... 
                         damn...
                              (loud whisper)
                         ...bedroom...

               Leo's eyes dart back and forth. Amphetamines. Bobby and Mike 
               look at each other.

                                     LEO
                         That's... a problem.

               He cocks the gun.

                                     BOBBY
                         I guess so. I guess it is. You know 
                         who?

                                     BOBBY
                         Sure... so do you know who?

                                     LEO
                         I will take care of it.

                                     BOBBY
                         Sure you will... and this other thing, 
                         hell, we'll take care of that, too, 
                         don't you worry about that. We'll 
                         get that cash and we'll square 
                         everything--

                         Go out for a pass.

                                     BOBBY
                         What?

                                     LEO
                         Go out. Run. Run.

               Bobby and Mike back away from him.

                                     BOBBY
                         Leo, take it easy, okay?

                                     LEO
                         Run!

               Bobby and Mike turn and start jogging away from him, back 
               towards the car, picking up speed, glancing over their 
               shoulders.

                                     MIKE
                         Oh God...

               As he reaches the clearing where the car is parked, we hear 
               a primal scream from the woods behind him.

               They turn as the scream dies away and they reach their car. 
               Something comes soaring up out of the woods and arcs down 
               towards them...

               ...the football thuds onto the hood of the car, scaring the 
               shit out of Mike and Bobby. They look at each other.

                                     BOBBY
                         Let's get the hell out of here.

               They jump into the car and speed off into the night.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               EXT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Dale Cooper is undressing for bed. He sets his bedside travel 
               alarm clock, takes off his wristwatch and sets it down, picks 
               up his tape recorder.

                                     COOPER
                         Diane, 1:18 a.m. Long day, turning 
                         in. Albert and his team should have 
                         something for us by morning. Run a 
                         check for me on a Jerry Horne, Twin 
                         Peaks businessman, Jerry with a "j", 
                         h-o-r-n-e. Nothing specific. Call it 
                         an instinct. Check that; intuition. 
                         An instinct is when you get hungry. 
                         Let's also get background on a local 
                         psychiatrist, Dr. Lawrence Jacoby, 
                         and wants-and-warrants on a truck 
                         driver, Leo Johnson, also local. The 
                         air here is fresh and crisp as a 
                         cracker; you don't sleep, you slumber. 
                         Good night, Diane.

               He turns off the recorder, sets it down. Picks up a roll of 
               dental floss and tears off a string.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PALMER BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Leland is on the phone, sitting on the edge of the bed. Sarah 
               sits listlessly in a chair.

                                     LELAND
                              (into the phone)
                         Yes... yes, Madelaine, dear, we'd 
                         appreciate it a great deal... the 
                         funeral's at two o'clock... alright, 
                         we'll look for you around noon... 
                         thank you, dear... drive safely.

               Leland hangs up, turns to Sarah.

                                     LELAND
                              (gently)
                         Sarah?... Sarah?

               Leland moves over to her and kneels down beside her, as she 
               turns towards him. During the following, he takes a pill 
               from a bottle, hands it to her, along with a glass of water.

                                     LELAND
                         Sarah, that was cousin Madelaine...

                                     SARAH
                              (a little hazy)
                         ...Donald's girl?

                                     LELAND
                         That's right, niece Madelaine.

                                     SARAH
                         ...is she here?

                                     LELAND
                         She's driving in, tomorrow. For the 
                         service.

                                     SARAH
                         Oh.

               Silence. Sarah takes the pill, drinks.

                                     SARAH
                         I'm going to go downstairs for a 
                         while.

                         Alright.

               A long pause before Sarah rises and slowly moves out of the 
               room. Leland fights back some tears. He takes a pill from 
               the bottle and swallows it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Dale Cooper lies asleep in bed. We move in slowly on him...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Sarah Palmer sits on a couch, eyes half-closed, fighting off 
               memories...

                                                                  INTERCUT:

               She moves up the stairs, the morning of the discovery of the 
               murder. She calls out Laura's name. She looks in her room.  
               She moves down the hall and calls again.

               Sarah shifts uneasily on the couch...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               She enters Laura's room and looks one way, then another... 
               one way, then another...

               Sarah opens her eyes in horror...

               A FRIGHTENING MAN is crouched in the corner by the foot of 
               Laura's bed, clutching the brass rails. It's the same man 
               Sarah saw in her vision the previous day.

               Sarah sits bolt upright and screams...

                                     SARAH
                         LELAND! I SAW HIM! OH! OH!

               Andy is playing "TAPS" on the trumpet. Lucy is sitting in a 
               chair hitting a ball attached by a string to a paddle. The 
               phone on the table beside her rings. She answers.

                         No--how is that possible?

                         I don't know, but she thinks with 
                         someone's help, she could draw the 
                         face that she remembers.

                                     LUCY
                         Actually, Tommy "The Hawk" Hill is 
                         our police sketch artist, he's very 
                         good, the pictures look just like 
                         the people he's drawing--

                                     LELAND
                         Lucy, can you please get the Sheriff 
                         and that Deputy over here right away?

                                     LUCY
                         Okay. You know, I've got an idea, as 
                         soon as we hang up, I'm going to try 
                         the Sheriff in his car, in his 
                         cruiser, and tell him everything 
                         you've told me--

                                     LELAND
                         Thank you, Lucy.

               He hangs up, shaking his head. We stay with Lucy as she hangs 
               up and quickly punches in another number.

                                     LUCY
                              (to Andy)
                         That was Mr. Palmer, he told me that 
                         he thinks his wife remembers that 
                         this morning, possibly when she was 
                         in her daughter's room that she saw 
                         the--
                              (leaving Andy hanging)
                         Hello, Sheriff?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Truman answers the radio call.

                         Yeah Lucy, what is it?

                                                                  INTERCUT:

               Lucy is on the phone.

                                     LUCY
                         Isn't it funny, I had a feeling you'd 
                         be in your cruiser--Sheriff, Mrs. 
                         Palmer was in her daughter's room 
                         this morning and she just remembered 
                         that--are you sitting down, of course 
                         you are, you're driving--she 
                         remembered that she--saw--the--killer.

                                     TRUMAN
                         You're kidding...

                                     LUCY
                         And they want you and Hawk to go 
                         over to their house, she wants Hawk 
                         to make a sketch--

                         I'll be right there--ten minutes.

               Agent Dale Cooper lies in bed, sleeping fitfully, troubled 
               by a dream.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               In shadow, a pay phone in the hospital corridor. A FIGURE 
               that we can't see picks up and dials the phone.

                                     FIGURE'S VOICE
                         Agent Dale Cooper, please... wake 
                         him...

               INT. COOPER'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Woken from his troubled sleep, Cooper answers the phone.

                                     COOPER
                              (answers the bedside 
                              phone)

                         Were you sleeping?

                                     COOPER
                         Yes, who is this?

                                     FIGURE'S VOICE
                         It's a strange night. There's 
                         something in the air, can you feel 
                         it?
                              (silence)
                         You know about Theresa Banks, the 
                         pretty girl they found last year?...

                                     COOPER
                         Yes, I know about Theresa...

                                     FIGURE'S VOICE
                         I know the man who did her... I know 
                         about the stitches, with the red 
                         thread... and there's more that I 
                         think you'd enjoy hearing... I'm at 
                         the hospital now.

                                     COOPER
                         I'm on my way.

               He hangs up the phone, starts to get out of bed, and the 
               phone rings again.

                                     COOPER
                         Agent Cooper...

               INT. LUCY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Lucy is on the phone, Andy is nearby, listening.

                                     LUCY
                         Hi, Agent Cooper, it's Lucy from 
                         work?

                                     COOPER
                         Are you still at work, Lucy?...

                                     LUCY
                         No, Andy and I are over at my place, 
                         Andy was playing the trumpet and we 
                         were getting ready for bed and do 
                         you know what happened?

                                     COOPER
                         No, tell me --
                              (stay with Cooper; a 
                              long answer)
                         Oh, oh, oh, uh-huh, okay, okay, I 
                         understand... Lucy, tell the Sheriff 
                         to get that sketch and meet me at 
                         the hospital--I've just received a 
                         phone call--

               Back on Cooper as he hangs up, picks up his tape recorder 
               and speaks into it as he starts to dress.

                         Diane, woken from a sound sleep at 
                         the Great Northern Hotel, room 315, 
                         it's 2:24 am. Received two phone 
                         calls, back to back; the first from 
                         a man unknown to me who had certain 
                         confidential information regarding 
                         the Theresa Banks murder. I'm on my 
                         way to meet him now. At the same 
                         time, Mrs. Palmer apparently 
                         remembered or had a vision of the 
                         killer. The Sheriff is on his way to 
                         her and will meet me afterwards. 
                         Diane, when two separate events happen 
                         simultaneously pertaining to the 
                         same object of inquiry, we must always 
                         pay strict attention.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Andy stands in the doorway. The One-Armed Man stands in the 
               shadows of the room. Cooper and Truman, carrying two police 
               sketches, join Andy.

                                     ANDY
                         He's unarmed. He wants to see you 
                         and he wants to see you in this 
                         particular room.

               Truman and Cooper turn towards the man.

                                     ONE-ARMED MAN
                         Don't turn on the overheads. The 
                         fluorescents don't work. I think a 
                         transformer's bad.

                                     COOPER
                         We know that.

                                     ONE-ARMED MAN
                         Yes. Wasn't Laura Palmer here earlier? 
                         "Through the darkness of futures

                         fire, walk with me"... We lived among 
                         the people. I think you say, 
                         convenience store. We lived above 
                         it. I mean it like it is, like is 
                         sounds... my name is Mike. His name 
                         is Bob.

                                     COOPER
                         You were in an elevator here.

                                     ONE-ARMED MAN
                         I was looking for Bob. He sometimes 
                         works among the infirm, the injured 
                         of the species. I was watching, Mr. 
                         Cooper, for over a year. Waiting for 
                         Bob to come out again. I've known of 
                         your interests in the results of his 
                         endeavors... I too have been touched 
                         by the devilish one. Tattoo on the 
                         left shoulder... oh, but when I saw 
                         the face of God, I was changed. I 
                         took the entire arm off.

               Truman and Cooper look at each other.

                         We'd like to show you a police sketch 
                         of Bob, for verification.

                         Of course.

                              bogus sketch)
                         No, no, that's not Bob.
                              (Truman holds up the 
                              correct sketch)

                              (to Cooper)
                         That's the man Mrs. Palmer identified.

                         Where is Bob?

                                     ONE-ARMED MAN
                         He's here. Right here. He's 
                         downstairs, in the basement.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOSPITAL BASEMENT BOILER ROOM - NIGHT

               Cooper and Truman enter the basement, guns drawn. KILLER 
               BOB, the frightening long-haired man, crouches over a circle 
               of candles on the far side of the room.

               Bob's hand reaches in and sets down a half of a heart necklace 
               onto a pile of dirt in the center of the candles.

               Truman and Cooper advance. Bob rises.

                                     KILLER BOB
                              (strangely)
                         Hello. Welcome to the killer's lair. 
                         Come down, I won't hurt you. Come 
                         down... is Mike with you?

                                     COOPER
                         No.

                                     KILLER BOB
                         Oh, I so much wanted to sing with 
                         him again. Mike? Mike, can you hear 
                         me? "Heads up, tails up, running to 
                         your scallywag Night falls, morning

                                     TRUMAN
                         The letters? What were the letters 
                         going to spell?

                                     KILLER BOB
                         Robert. That's my proper name. 
                         Theresa's was a "t."

                                     COOPER
                         That's right.

               Behind Cooper and Truman, unseen by them, Mike is coming up 
               behind them, a gun in his hand.

                                     KILLER BOB
                         You may think I've gone insane. But 
                         I promise, I will kill again!

                                     MIKE
                         Ahh! Like Hell!!!

               Mike runs up and fires his gun twice. Bob goes down, mortally 
               wounded. Mike clutches a pole and twists to the ground, in 
               agonizing sympathetic pain.

                                     MIKE
                         Bob... Bob, it hurts something 
                         terrible... wait... wait till your 
                         turn, Bob... oh Bob... wait till 
                         your turn...

               Mike dies. Truman takes his gun away. Cooper looks over at 
               the candles.

                                     COOPER
                         Make a wish.

               A breeze blows out the candles...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               A title card reads: TWENTY-FIVE YEARS LATER

               INT. RED-DRAPED ROOM - DAY

               A large, windowless, well-lit, sparsely furnished, red-draped 
               room. A table and three easy chairs. Dale Cooper, twenty-
               five years older, sits in one of the chairs. A LITTLE MAN, 
               three and a half feet tall, in a red suit, stands with his 
               back to Cooper, shaking violently. A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN 
               who looks exactly like Laura Palmer sits across from Cooper 
               in another easy chair.

               The Little Man stops shaking, turns to Cooper and claps his 
               hands once.

                                     LITTLE MAN
                         Let's rock!

               The Little Man sits in a chair beside the beautiful woman. 
               The Little Man closes his eyes and rubs his hands slowly 
               together.

               The Little Man holds hands with the Woman, they look at each 
               other, then look at Cooper, smiling enigmatically. The Little 
               Man rubs his hands slowly again; the shadow of a bird passes 
               above them.

               Both the Little Man and the Woman's speech is oddly stilted. 
               We see sub-titles under them, with the correct words.  
               Throughout, Cooper sits still, watches, and listens.

                                     LITTLE MAN
                         I've got good news! That gum you 
                         like is going to come back in style. 
                         She's my cousin, but doesn't she 
                         look almost exactly like Laura Palmer?

                                     COOPER
                         But it is Laura Palmer. Are you Laura 
                         Palmer?

                                     WOMAN
                         I feel like I know her, but sometimes 
                         my arms bend back.

                                     LITTLE MAN
                         She's filled with secrets. Where 
                         we're from, the birds sing a pretty 
                         song and there's always music in the 
                         air.

               Strange saxophone music filters into the air. The Little Man 
               hops off the chair and begins to dance a strange dance around 
               the table. The Woman rises, goes over, and gently kisses 
               Cooper on the mouth. She softly whispers something in his 
               ear.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. COOPER'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Cooper shoots up out of his bed, waking from this strange 
               and disturbing dream. He fumbles for the phone and dials.

                                     COOPER
                         Harry, it's Cooper, meet me for 
                         breakfast, seven o'clock, here at 
                         the hotel. I know who killed Laura 
                         Palmer.

               He hangs up.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                         THE END
