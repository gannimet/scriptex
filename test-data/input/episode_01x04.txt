               INT. PALMER'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING

               The homecoming photograph of Laura Palmer sits on a table 
               next to the sofa.

               We see a SKETCH PAD, a portrait of a frightening man, with 
               long, filthy hair. Deputy ANDY BRENNAN sits on the sofa making 
               the sketch. SARAH PALMER sits next to him, describing the 
               man in her vision in a tense whisper. Next to Sarah and 
               holding her hand is DONNA HAYWARD. Behind them stands SHERIFF 
               TRUMAN, studying Andy's work. On a chair beside the couch 
               DOC HAYWARD sits with medication at the ready.

                                     SARAH
                         His hair was long. Filthy grey on 
                         grey, long hair.

               MADELEINE FERGUSON appears quietly behind Truman with a tray 
               of coffee cups. She hands one to Truman and another cup to 
               Doc Hayward. She starts to place a cup in front of Sarah, 
               but with a gentle hand the doctor discourages this.

                                     SARAH
                              (struggling)
                         I saw him, by the foot of Laura's 
                         bed. He was like an animal.

               The scene is interrupted by a thump at the doorway. LELAND 
               PALMER totters in, unshaven.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Had you ever seen this man before?

                                     SARAH
                         No... never.

               Andy looks at Truman, who nods; Andy shows the sketch to 
               Sarah.

                                     SARAH
                         His face... oh, God, his face

               Sarah's head rocks back on to the top of the sofa. She's 
               starting to lose it.

                                     LELAND
                         Sarah? Have you told them about the 
                         necklace? They'll love that one.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Necklace?

                                     LELAND
                         She had two visions.
                              (winks at them)

                                     TRUMAN
                         Go ahead, Sarah.

               Leland rises and heads unsteadily out of the room.

                                     SARAH
                         It's night. A flashlight beam moves 
                         across the ground then a hand... a 
                         gloved hand... lifts a rock and takes 
                         out a necklace. Broken in half... it 
                         was Laura's...

               CAMERA MOVES IN on a frightened Donna.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Lucy sits at her desk glued to a small portable televison 
               set.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Don't fight it, Chet.

                                     CHET
                         I'm still married to Jade. It's wrong.
                              (he turns away, 
                              struggling to control 
                              himself)
                         God... you're evil...

                                     EMERALD
                         For once in your life, Chet, you're 
                         exactly right.
                              (she takes Chet into 
                              a passionate kiss)
                         I want to see my father's will, Chet.
                              (another kiss. Chet 
                              melts)
                         Get it for me.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               LUCY

               Entering the station, Andy and Truman cruise up to her window.

                                     TRUMAN
                         'Morning, Lucy, what's going on?

                                     LUCY
                         Thanks to Jade, Jared decided not to 
                         kill himself and he's changed his 
                         will leaving the Towers to Jade 
                         instead of Emerald, but Emerald found 
                         out about it and now she's trying to 
                         seduce Chet to give her the new will 
                         so she can destroy it and Montana's 
                         planning to kill Jared at midnight 
                         so the Towers will belong to Emerald 
                         and Montana, but I think Emerald's 
                         going to doublecross him and he 
                         doesn't know it yet. Poor Chet.

                                     TRUMAN
                         What's going on... here.

                         Agent Cooper is in the conference 
                         room with Dr. Jacoby.

               Truman starts for the conference room. Andy hangs back to 
               talk to Lucy.

                                     ANDY
                         So I guess Chet's really got his 
                         hands full, huh?... Lucy, why couldn't 
                         I spend the night last night?

                                     LUCY
                         And will you be having coffee as 
                         well, Deputy Brennan?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. INTERROGATION ROOM A - DAY

               DR. JACOBY and AGENT DALE COOPER sit across the table from 
               each other. Jacoby plays idly with a golf ball, practicing 
               sleight-of-hand.

                                     COOPER
                         Was Laura Palmer seeing you because 
                         she was addicted to cocaine?

                                     JACOBY
                         I'd like to help you, Agent Cooper. 
                         Maybe there is some sort of hula we 
                         can do around my doctor-patient 
                         confidentiality.

               The blackboard from Episode Two stands behind Cooper. The 
               map of Tibet looks over Cooper's shoulder. Jacoby rises and 
               circles towards it. Truman enters. Cooper nods to him.

                                     COOPER
                         It is safe to say Laura came to see 
                         you because she had problems.

                                     JACOBY
                         Oh my yes.

                                     COOPER
                         Were her problems of a sexual nature?

                                     JACOBY
                         Agent Cooper, the problems of our 
                         entire society are of a sexual nature.
                              (studies the map)
                         Tibet. My abiding interests lie to 
                         the east as well, though only as far 
                         as Hawaii. Five years post-graduate 
                         work. There are sound solutions to 
                         our diseased family structures in 
                         native Hawaiian culture.

                                     COOPER
                         So there were problems at home.

                                     JACOBY
                         The ancient Hawaiians often turned 
                         to the soothing rhizome of the ginger 
                         plant to case the pain of profound 
                         confusion which, more often than 
                         not, was sexual.

                                     COOPER
                         Ginger is not addictive. Cocaine is.

                                     JACOBY
                         The fact that Laura Palmer sought 
                         medication, no matter how dubious, 
                         was actually a positive sign.

                                     COOPER
                              (frustrated)
                         Dr. Jacoby, I know that you cared 
                         deeply for Laura. Why won't you help 
                         us?

                                     JACOBY
                         I would like to. My own personal 
                         investigation, I suspect, will be 
                         ongoing for the rest of my life.
                              (not unaffected)
                         Laura had secrets. And around those 
                         secrets she built a fortress that in 
                         my six months with her I could not 
                         penetrate. For which I consider myself 
                         an abject failure.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Did she discuss Bobby Briggs and 
                         James Hurley?

                                     JACOBY
                         They were boys. Laura was a woman.

                                     COOPER
                         She had sex with three men the night 
                         she died. Were you one of them?

                                     JACOBY
                         No.

                                     COOPER
                              (bottom line)
                         Who killed her, Dr. Jacoby?

                                     JACOBY
                              (walking a fine line)
                         The night after Laura died I followed 
                         a man Laura had spoken to me about. 
                         He was driving a red corvette. I 
                         lost him near the Old Sawmill Road.  
                         That, gentlemen, is all I can tell 
                         you.

               Lucy interrupts on the intercom.

                                     LUCY'S VOICE
                         Agent Cooper, there is a Gordon Cole 
                         on the phone. He says you're expecting 
                         his call and that I should put him 
                         through to you, should I?

                                     COOPER
                         Put him through.
                              (to Jacoby)
                         That will be all.

                                     TRUMAN
                         You'll be in town, Doctor?

                                     JACOBY
                         I'm planning a pilgrimage to Pebble 
                         Beach, but that's not 'til the end 
                         of the month.

                         Hang loose, Houlies.

               He's gone. Cooper sets up the speaker phone on the table in 
               front of a chair.

                                     COOPER
                         Does Leo Johnson drive a red corvette?

                                     TRUMAN
                         Yes.

                                     TRUMAN
                         There's an APB on him. His brother 
                         Bernie made bail this morning. I've 
                         put a tail on him.

                              on the speaker)
                         Good morning, Gordon, how are we 
                         doing?

                         The Palmer girl or Albert's new best 
                         friend, Harry Truman.

                         Laura Palmer.

                         Albert has been very busy despite 
                         the handsome shiner. The twine he 
                         found on her upper arms is a common 
                         household variety: Finley's Fine 
                         Twine.

                                     COOPER
                         And the twine on her wrists?

                                     COLE'S VOICE
                         Definitely not a match. No ID yet. 
                         And those marks on her shoulders? 
                         Bird bites. Albert thinks he'll have 
                         specifics this afternoon vis-a-vis 
                         genus and species.

                         He'll also be faxing a reconstruction 
                         of the plastic fragment from her 
                         stomach.

                                     COOPER
                         Tell Albert we're anxiously awaiting 
                         his results.

                                     COLE'S VOICE
                         Now for the bad news. Coop, I've got 
                         an O.O.J. and an A.F.O. here from 
                         Albert concerning his mano y mano 
                         with the local Sheriff Truman.

               Truman makes a gesture offering to leave. Cooper motions him 
               to stay.

                                     COLE
                         Albert wants this guy's badge.

               We can almost hear Harry's expletive as he goes to the window.

                                     COOPER
                         Gordon, here's how it is: you know 
                         Albert. In my opinion, Sheriff Truman 
                         displayed the patience of a saint in 
                         not clocking him a day earlier than 
                         he did--

                         He wants it filed with the U.S. 
                         Attorney--

                                     COOPER
                         File it under "f" for "forget it"--

                         And you tell Albert, if he wants to 
                         pursue this I'll fight him all the 
                         way up the chain to Washington. I'll 
                         talk to you later, Gordon.

               Cooper hangs up as Andy enters with his sketch.

                         I thanks, I didn't sleep too well 
                         last night.

                                     COOPER
                         Harry, the last thing you're gonna 
                         worry about while I'm here is some 
                         city slicker I brought into your 
                         town relieving himself upstream.
                              (takes the sketch 
                              from Andy)
                         This is the man I saw in my dream.

                                     TRUMAN
                         You saw this man?

                                     COOPER
                         I had an intuition that my dream and 
                         Sarah Palmer's vision were connected. 
                         I didn't go with you this morning so 
                         I wouldn't influence her. I'm a strong 
                         sender.
                              (he hands the sketch 
                              back to Andy)
                         The eyes were a bit closer together.

               The intercom buzzes.

               ED and his assistant, SPARKY, a wizened eager beaver, enter 
               and tiptoe into the living room to examine Nadine's rowing 
               machine. The oars are bent like a "z."

                                     ED
                         Watch you don't track any grease, 
                         Sparky.
                              (they kneel down and 
                              look at the machine)
                         How the heck could Nadine bend the 
                         thing like that?

                                     SPARKY
                         That's tempered steel, Edsker.

               Ed glances at the window, picks up the phone.

                         Nadine's still rummaging around out 
                         in the garage. Catch an eye, will 
                         ya, Sparky.

               Ed dials. After a couple of rings his call is answered.

                         important.

               SHELLY JOHNSON has answered Ed's call. As she talks she 
               watches "Invitation to Love" on the tube, with the sounds 
               turned down

                                                                  INTERCUT:

                         You just missed her, Ed. She's left 
                         for Hank's parole hearing.

                                     ED
                         Shoot. Shelly, when she gets back 
                         could you tell her...

               Sparky sees Nadine approaching. He gives Ed the high sign, 
               takes out a wrench and moves back to the rowing machine. 
               NADINE HURLEY enters carrying a breakfast tray.

                         nuts.

               He hangs up the phone and turns to Nadine. She displays the 
               tray, loaded with food, a newspaper, a pot of coffee and a 
               grease gun. Nadine smiles seductively at Ed.

                                     NADINE
                         Eggs and bacon and sausage and ham 
                         and and whole wheat toast and juice 
                         and coffee. And the sports section, 
                         and a grease gun for working on my 
                         rower.

                         I'm gonna get a good lawyer, Ed.

               She kisses him. He's alarmed. She whispers.

                                     NADINE
                         There's a damn good patent lawyer in

               NORMA JENNINGS sits pensively on a bench outside the door. 
               WILSON MOONEY, the parole officer, emerges from another door 
               to the cell block.

                                     MOONEY
                         I've arranged for you to have a little 
                         chat with Hank before the hearing. 
                         He's glad you're here.
                              (a tad nervous)
                         Hope I didn't come on too strong 
                         yesterday--

                                     NORMA
                         I'll be sure to tell him how helpful 
                         you've been, Mr. Mooney.

               Mooney moves off. The door to the cell block opens and HANK 
               JENNINGS is led out by a GUARD. Hank is forty, good looking 
               in a rough way. Alarmingly charming. He brightens as the 
               Guard leads him towards Norma who slowly stands as Hank 
               reaches her.

                                     HANK
                         Haven't seen you for awhile, Norma.

                                     NORMA
                         Been kind'a busy.

                                     HANK
                         So... business is good.

                                     NORMA
                         Yeah.

               Pause. Hank seems suddenly, terribly vulnerable.

                                     HANK
                         Back me up in there, Norma, please. 
                         I gotta get out. It's starting to 
                         put the zap on me, big time.

                                     NORMA
                              (pause, a whisper)
                         You think it's that easy?

                                     HANK
                         I know I've got no right to ask and 
                         you've got no reason to believe me, 
                         but... I'll change. I swear on my 
                         life. I have changed. Give me a chance 
                         to prove it to you.

               The Guard steps back in and moves him away. A hint of weakness 
               in Norma's eyes.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PAROLE BOARD HEARING ROOM - DAY

               Hank sits at a long table with Mooney, across from two BOARD 
               MEMBERS, a middle-aged neatnik and a younger woman with a 
               granite bouffant hairdo. Three other BOARD MEMBERS are spread 
               around the table. Norma sits to one side and watches Hank.

                                     HANK
                         I've replayed it my mind a million 
                         times. I just don't have any answers. 
                         A car in perfect condition goes out 
                         of control. A vagrant nobody knows 
                         is killed sleeping on the roadside. 
                         Why? Why did fate deal me this hand?

                                     MALE BOARD MEMBER
                         You were not incarcerated for an act 
                         of fate, Mr. Jennings.

                                     HANK
                         I accept that. But it was fate, maybe 
                         in an odd way, even luck that sent 
                         me to prison. Just as much as that 
                         accident.

                                     WOMAN BOARD MEMBER
                         What is your point?

                                     HANK
                         That my time here has been good for 
                         me. You don't spend eighteen months 
                         in a nine-by-five box without facing 
                         your life. Without figuring what 
                         went wrong with your life before. 
                         Without planning to make it better. 
                         Without learning to get down on your 
                         hands and knees and pray for a second 
                         chance.
                              (pause)
                         I know I've got a lot to make up 
                         for. The life I destroyed... and 
                         another life I very nearly destroyed.

               Hank takes a long loving look at Norma. Board members study 
               her.

                                     WOMAN BOARD MEMBER
                         Mrs. Jennings, your husband would be 
                         facing a difficult re-entry. How 
                         would you help him?

                                     NORMA
                         I own the Double R Diner in Twin 
                         Peaks. I can give him a job. The 
                         boss is tough, but fair.

               This gets a slight chuckle from the board.

                                     WOMAN BOARD MEMBER
                         And you would live together as man 
                         and wife?

               Pause. Hank edges his seat forward, it makes a loud scraping 
               noise. Norma looks at Hank.

                                     NORMA
                         He's my husband, isn't he?

               Pause. Hank mouths a silent, "thank you."

                                     MALE BOARD MEMBER
                         We've got what we need here. We'll 
                         decide what recommendation to make 
                         without the inmate present.

                                     WOMAN BOARD MEMBER TWO
                         We'll let you know by five o'clock 
                         today.

               Hank idly rubs a key chain. Its handle is a WHITE DOMINO 
               with SIX BLACK DOTS.

               Hank is led out by the Guard. Norma watches him go.

                                     HANK
                              (smiles, says quietly)
                         Catch you later.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                       END ACT ONE

                                         ACT TWO

               FADE IN:

               EXT. TWIN PEAKS HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

               Re-establish. A bell rings.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. TWIN PEAKS HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS' ROOM - DAY

               Donna Hayward stands in front of the mirror, looking at 
               herself, brushing her hair. AUDREY HORNE enters and 
               immediately lights a cigarette.

                                     AUDREY
                         I've been doing some research. In 
                         real life there is no algebra.

                                     DONNA
                         Maybe you should run away and join 
                         the circus.

                                     AUDREY
                         Escape! I've got a better idea. A 
                         tall, dark and handsome stranger 
                         falls madly in love with me and takes 
                         me away to a life of mystery and 
                         international intrigue.

                                     DONNA
                         You mean that FBI Agent? Dream on.

                                     AUDREY
                         Maybe. Or maybe he'll realize I'm 
                         the woman of his dreams because I'm 
                         going to help him figure out who 
                         killed Laura.

                                     DONNA
                         Is that so?

                                     AUDREY
                         Yes. And you're going to help me. 
                         Fact: Laura was seeing James Hurley 
                         behind Bobby's back.

                                     DONNA
                              (defensive)
                         What if she was?

                                     AUDREY
                              (off her reaction)
                         So it is true. Fact: Laura had a 
                         sweet tooth for nose candy.

                                     DONNA
                         I guess that's not such a big secret.

                                     AUDREY
                         Please. I didn't know Laura half as 
                         well as you and I knew the score; 
                         Laura was wild. Will you help me?

                                     DONNA
                              (getting into it)
                         What else have you figured out, 
                         Sherlock?

                                     AUDREY
                         The morning of the funeral, Dr. 
                         Jacoby's talking to my, brother 
                         Johnny, trying to get him to go to 
                         the funeral...
                              (offers a cigarette 
                              to Donna who declines)
                         So he tells Johnny that Laura was in 
                         a better place now, blah, blah, blah 
                         and he knows that... because... Laura 
                         was his patient.

                                     DONNA
                              (new information)
                         Laura was seeing Jacoby?

                                     AUDREY
                         Mucho de-weirdo, huh? It gets better. 
                         Ever heard of "One-Eyed Jacks?"

                                     DONNA
                         Isn't that a Western with Marlon 
                         Brando?

                                     AUDREY
                         No. It's a place up north across the 
                         border. They have "girls" working 
                         there.

               Audrey takes a long drag on her cigarette for effect. Donna's 
               intrigued

                                     DONNA
                         Are you saying you think Laura was 
                         one of them?

                                     AUDREY
                         I don't know. But if it's true, 
                         wouldn't you want to know about it?

                                     DONNA
                         It sure would explain a few things.

                                     AUDREY
                         You know, I think about it, I think 
                         about Laura being in a place like 
                         that and I get all shivery, but it's 
                         like a hot cold, like when you hold 
                         an ice cube on your bare skin for a 
                         long time.

                                     DONNA
                         Audrey, I'll help you but whatever 
                         we find out, we have to promise to 
                         keep this between ourselves. Our 
                         secret.

                                     AUDREY
                         It's a deal. And I know exactly where 
                         to start, did you know Ronette and 
                         Laura worked at the same place.

               Donna didn't. The school bell rings for class. Audrey douses 
               her cigarette in the sink.

                                     AUDREY
                         The perfume counter of my father's 
                         department store.

               Audrey goes out.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. TIMER FALLS MOTEL - DAY

               A car door. The door opens and a hand pours the remains of a 
               cup of coffee out of an expensive piece of china. The coffee 
               drips onto the dirt of the parking lot. CAMERA MOVES UP to 
               reveal JOSIE PACKARD behind the wheel. She focuses a camera 
               with a telescopic lens.

               CAMERA MOVES BACK to show Josie in her Jaguar outside the 
               motel, parked next to a construction dumpster in the dirt 
               parking lot.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The document is rolled up and inserted in Emerald's purse.

                                     CHET
                         Emerald, don't--

                                     JADE
                              (seeing Emerald)
                         What are you doing here?

                                     EMERALD
                         I think it's time we all had a nice 
                         talk.

               As this plays out there is LOUD ORGASMIC GROANING off camera.

                                     BEN HORNE'S VOICE
                         Oh... yes... yes... there... yes...

               CAMERA MOVES BACK to reveal CATHERINE MARTELL on the bed 
               giving BEN HORNE a post-coital back rub.

                                     CATHERINE
                         --I wish I could have seen Josie's 
                         face, opening the safe to show her 
                         lawman Romeo the double set of 
                         books... and all she finds is the 
                         one I've been slowly cooking.

                                     BEN
                         Where's the book that spells 
                         bankruptcy?

                                     CATHERINE
                         I have more than one hiding place. 
                         My desk, upstairs. A drop panel in 
                         the top drawer. Not even Pete the 
                         poodle knows about that one.

               Catherine takes a sip of wine, turns off the TV set with a 
               remote.

                                     CATHERINE
                         I'm famished. I suppose room service 
                         is too much to ask of this rusticated 
                         mildew farm.

                                     BEN
                         You'd prefer the "Lumber Baron Suite" 
                         at the Great Northern?

                                     CATHERINE
                         I'd prefer that we get on with setting 
                         the torch to that damn mill. Because 
                         I want... fill in the blank.

                              (turns over)
                         Darling, one crosses the border into 
                         arson cautiously or not at all. When 
                         the mill goes up in smoke, the 
                         headline we're after is "Josie Packard 
                         torches bankrupt mill in insurance 
                         fraud" not "giant wienie roast in 
                         the woods."

                                     CATHERINE
                         That's fine and dandy. Just bear in 
                         mind, "darling," that if this 
                         opportunity is wasted, or you in 
                         some way... disappoint me...
                              (some kind of physical 
                              reinforcement)
                         ...they're going to find your antlers 
                         being used as a hood ornament on a 
                         hillbilly's pick-up truck.

                              smile)
                         Darling... Me? Disappoint you?

                                     CATHERINE
                         Perish the thought.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MOTEL - DAY

               Truman's cruiser pulls up by the dumpster. Josie's car is 
               gone. Cooper, Truman, and Andy get out of cruiser. Hawk walks 
               up to meet them.

                                     HAWK
                         Room 301. Last name is Gerard.

               The foursome moves cautiously towards a room. Truman takes 
               the lead, motions Hawk to go around to the side. Hawk moves 
               off. They reach the door. Truman knocks.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Open up, please, it's the police.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MOTEL ROOM B - DAY

               Still no answer from inside. Truman slowly takes out his 
               pistol. Cooper draws his, Andy nervously takes out his gun; 
               he drops it and it DISCHARGES. Cooper glares at Andy. Truman 
               picks up the gun and waves Andy to the back.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MOTEL ROOM B - DAY

               The door is opened by a genial, mild mannered ONE-ARMED MAN, 
               ringing wet from a shower, a towel wrapped around his waist.

                                     GERARD
                         Sorry, I was in the shower...
                              (sees the weapons)

                                     TRUMAN
                              (not taking any chances)
                         Sir, please move back into the room... 
                         slowly.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MOTEL ROOM

               Ben picks up his clothes.

                                     BEN
                         I'm going to give Little Elvis a 
                         bath.

               He goes into the bathroom. Catherine laughs, then notices 
               something has dropped out of Ben's pants. Catherine crosses 
               and picks it up.

                                                                  INTERCUT:

               INSERT

               A THOUSAND DOLLAR POKER CHIP from One-Eyed Jack's.

               Catherine slow-burns with anger.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. MOTEL ROOM B - DAY

               The one armed Man, now in a bathrobe, sits on the bed studying 
               Andy's sketch. Hawk is on the phone holding a wallet.

                                     HAWK
                         Wants and warrants on a Phillip 
                         Michael Gerard.

               The man hands the sketch back to Truman.

                                     GERARD
                         No sir, never seen that man before. 
                         Sorry. But you know what? 'Kind of 
                         looks like somebody doesn't he?

               Truman walks over to two suitcases that sit by the bed.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Do you mind if we look in these?

                                     GERARD
                         Help yourself.

               With a nod from the sheriff Andy moves to the suitcases

                                     COOPER
                         Mr. Gerard, do you have a friend 
                         named Bob?

                                     GERARD
                         Bob... oh, you mean Bob Lydecker. 
                         Sure, Bob's my best friend. I'm on 
                         my western swing, I heard about it, 
                         I'm in town visiting him in the 
                         hospital. Bob's in a coma.

                                     TRUMAN
                         There was a Lydecker assaulted three 
                         days ago outside a bar in Lowtown.

                                     GERARD
                         That's Bob.

                                     COOPER
                         Any suspects?

                                     TRUMAN
                         No.

                                     COOPER
                         Is your friend Bob a doctor?

                                     GERARD
                         He's a veterinarian. Just about the 
                         best darn veterinarian in these parts. 
                         Extremely dedicated. Has his own 
                         clinic about eight years now. No 
                         maybe seven. Let's see...'81... I'm 
                         still at computer school... yeah, 
                         it's eight years.

                                     COOPER
                         In my dream he was a regular doctor.

                                     GERARD
                         What's that, mister?

               Hawk hangs up the phone, hands Gerard's wallet to Truman.

                                     HAWK
                         He's clean.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Take a look at his car.

               Hawk takes the keys and goes out. Cooper looks at Gerard's 
               ID.

                                     COOPER
                         Your middle name is "Michael?"

                                     GERARD
                         Named after my uncle. Uncle Mike.

                                     COOPER
                         How did you lose your arm?

                                     GERARD
                         Car accident. I was on the road from 
                         Memphis to someplace, selling 
                         pharmaceuticals. Pretty good job, 
                         Smokey Mountains Sales Rep. I had 
                         benefits.

               In background Andy's checking Gerard's suitcases. One of 
               them practically explodes open. A pile of WORKBOOTS and 
               INSTITUTIONAL SHOES fall out.

                                     GERARD
                         That's what I'm selling these days. 
                         Everybody needs shoes, don't they?

                                     ANDY
                         They're all for the right foot.

                                     GERARD
                         Those are just samples, son. We mail 
                         order all our sales, two-day delivery 
                         guaranteed. And we could certainly 
                         take care of your departmental needs, 
                         if your interested.

               Cooper, with Gerard's wallet still in his hand, reaches behind 
               Gerard's drivers license, takes out one of Gerard's cards, 
               and hands it to Truman.

                                     COOPER
                         The arm you lost, did it have a 
                         tattoo?

                                     GERARD
                              (strangely distressed)
                         What is this all about? I'm a shoe 
                         salesman--

                                     TRUMAN
                         Settle down, he just asked you a 
                         question--

                                     COOPER
                         If you won't tell us, we can find 
                         out. What did it say?

                                     GERARD
                         It said "MOM."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               As Cooper and Andy get into Truman's cruiser, Hawk discretely 
               motions Truman over to the dumpster. Hawk kneels down, dips 
               his finger in the spilled coffee, speaks quietly.

                                     HAWK
                         Car was staked out when I got here. 
                         It was Josie Packard.
                              (they exchange a look. 
                              Truman's puzzled)
                         And not that it means anything, but 
                         Ben Horne's car was parked two blocks 
                         away.

               INT. LEO JOHNSON'S HOUSE - DAY

               We discover Shelly Johnson and BOBBY BRIGGS in a steamy kiss.

                                     SHELLY
                         I feel so bad for you.

               Bobby gives her a confused look.

                                     SHELLY
                         I was watching you at the funeral. 
                         My heart was aching, I wanted to 
                         hold you so much.

                                     BOBBY
                         That James Hurley. He was seeing 
                         Laura behind my back. I'm gonna fix 
                         him.

               Another kiss.

                                     SHELLY
                         Fix me first.

               Shelly begins to unbutton Bobby's shirt.

                                     BOBBY
                         Where's Leo?

                                     SHELLY
                         Don't worry, bad boy, I can hear his 
                         'Vette a mile away.

                                     BOBBY
                         Don't mess around about this, Shelly, 
                         where is he?

                                     SHELLY
                         He took off with his friend, that 
                         creepy Jacques.

                                     BOBBY
                         Jacques who?

                                     SHELLY
                         Jacques that Canuck guy who works at 
                         the Roadhouse.

               Bobby breaks away from Shelly.

                                     BOBBY
                         Leo and Jacques.

                                     SHELLY
                         What's the matter?

                                     BOBBY
                         I gotta think. I gotta think.

                                     SHELLY
                              (still on sex)
                         Think later. I got to be back at the 
                         diner in a half hour.

               Bobby makes a decision. Lie.

                                     BOBBY
                         Shelly, I gotta tell you something.

                                     SHELLY
                         What?

                                     BOBBY
                         I've been on to this for a while, 
                         I've been checking it out. It's pretty 
                         bad.

                                     SHELLY
                         Tell me.

                                     BOBBY
                         Leo and Jacques are running drugs 
                         across the border. Cocaine. And 
                         they're selling 'em to kids at school.

                                     SHELLY
                         Oh my God, I knew it, I knew Leo was 
                         messed up in something.

                                     BOBBY
                         I know it's shocking. I think it's 
                         even possible that they were giving 
                         drugs to Laura.

                                     SHELLY
                              (goes pale)
                         Bobby? Bobby, I got to show you 
                         something. Oh my God.

               She goes to her secret hiding place behind the cabinet and 
               takes out Leo's bloody shirt.

                                     SHELLY
                         This was in Leo's truck, two days 
                         after Laura was murdered.

                                     BOBBY
                         You sure this is Leo's?

                                     SHELLY
                         It's got his initials sewn in the 
                         collar, see? He makes me sew labels 
                         into everything--

                                     BOBBY
                         Shelly, this... this could be the 
                         answer to our prayers.

                                     SHELLY
                         What do you mean?

                                     BOBBY
                              (takes the shirt)
                         You don't need to know. I'm gonna 
                         take this. You never saw it. Say it, 
                         "you never saw this--"

                                     SHELLY
                         I never saw it.

                                     BOBBY
                              (mind racing)
                         Leo is not going to be a problem for 
                         us anymore. You stay clear of him 
                         and don't say anything--

               She lifts her gun out of the hiding place.

                                     SHELLY
                         I bought this.

                                     BOBBY
                         You know how to use it?

                                     SHELLY
                         I thought you might be able to teach 
                         me.
                              (getting hot)
                         Teach me, Bobby. Will you?

               Lust.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         In my dream. Mike said he and Bob 
                         lived above a convenience store.

               Cooper is standing in front of a convenience store, the TWIN 
               PEAKS ECONO SHOPPER. Two stories high. Truman stands next to 
               Cooper.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I'd think you'd be afraid to go to 
                         sleep at night.

               Behind them Andy and Hawk get out of Hawk's patrol car.

                                     COOPER
                         Andy, would you please go into the 
                         Econo Shopper and buy some twine?

                                     ANDY
                         Okay.

               CAMERA MOVES UP to a shop above the convenience store. A 
               sign reads: "Lydecker Veterinarian Clinic - Aid to the Beast 
               Incarnate"

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE LYDEKER CLINIC - DAY

               Cooper and Truman stand at a counter. Behind the counter 
               Lydecker's assistant MIDGE LOOMER looks at the sketch then 
               hands it back to Truman.

                                     LOOMER
                         Nope. That's not Dr. Lydecker.

                                     COOPER
                         Does Dr. Lydeker treat birds?

                                     LOOMER
                         Oh, yes.

                         There's a lot of vets in Twin Peaks.

                         Only one has a best friend with one 
                         arm. Harry, in the heat of 
                         investigative pursuit, the shortest 
                         distance between two points is not 
                         necessarily a straight line.

               Andy enters with a brown bag.

                                     COOPER

                         Fine Twine.

               Amazed, Andy reaches into the bag and takes out... a spool 
               of Finley's Fine Twine.

                                     COOPER

                         confiscate your files.
                              (to Cooper)

               they look good.

                                     LELAND
                         Dance with me! Dance with me!

                                     BEN
                         Leland. Leland.

               Leland goes into a dance solo towards Ben. Hands him a framed 
               picture. Ben looks at it: a snapshot photo of Laura and 
               Audrey.

                                     LELAND
                         This was on your desk! Our daughters, 
                         together!

               Ben pushes his way in between Leland and the secretary.

                                     BEN
                         Mind if I cut in?

               Once in, Ben moves the Secretary away from Leland. Ben lets 
               her out of the room, goes back to Leland and grabs him firmly 
               by the shoulders.

                                     BEN
                         Leland. Leland. You gave me that 
                         picture, remember?
                              (Leland comes to a 
                              stop)
                         Calm down. Stop it.

                                     LELAND
                         She loved dancing. She loved to 
                         dance... she'd stand on my shoes... 
                         I taught her... come and dance with 
                         me... she was a good little dancer...

               He cries. Ben takes him into an embrace. Pats him on the 
               back.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION RECEPTION AREA - DAY

               Cooper, Truman, Andy and Hawk enter carrying files from the 
               veterinarian's, past Lucy at reception. Truman rests his for 
               a moment on Lucy's counter.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Fellas, take 'em right into the 
                         conference room. Lucy, I need you to 
                         go through these files and pull out 
                         all the people who own birds.

                                     LUCY
                         How will I know they own birds?

                                     TRUMAN
                         It will say so on the cards.

                                     LUCY
                         Okay, I'll start going through the 
                         files, then.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. INTERROGATION A - DAY

               Hawk sets his box down and exits. Cooper is about to exit 
               when Andy takes him aside.

                                     ANDY
                         Agent Cooper? I'm so sorry, I don't 
                         know what happened, the gun just 
                         slipped out of my hand.

                                     COOPER
                         Have you ever used your weapon in 
                         the line of duty?

                                     ANDY
                         No, sir, I haven't. I can't explain 
                         what happened, I've been feeling a 
                         little high-strung--

                                     COOPER
                         It was a lack of preparation. We'll 
                         take care of that.

               TRUMAN ENTERS TO SAY:

                                     TRUMAN
                         Andy, get some ammunition from the 
                         lockbox and meet us downstairs at 
                         the pistol range.

               Cooper and Truman exit.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SHERIFF'S RECEPTION AREA - DAY

               Andy goes into Lucy's office to retrieve a key. Lucy won't 
               look at him, slides her chair out of the way, lets him take 
               the key. Andy's aching.

                                     ANDY
                         Lucy, did you hear what happened? I 
                         feel so dumb. I dropped my gun and 
                         it went off.

                                     LUCY
                              (a hint of concern)
                         Are you okay?

                                     ANDY
                         Oh, yeah, I guess so, but I...

                                     LUCY
                              (remembering the war 
                              of the sexes)
                         I would like to chat, but I am now 
                         under orders to examine these files, 
                         so if you'll excuse me please?

               She exits. Andy's completely perplexed.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FIRING RANGE - DAY

               Cooper, Truman, and Hawk set up at the basement shooting 
               range. There are two targets at the end of corridors for 
               them to shoot at.

                                     COOPER
                         Laura Palmer's murder was vicious 
                         and calculated. There's no telling 
                         what we'll encounter bringing a 
                         suspect to ground. After Andy's 
                         accident at the motel I want to be 
                         absolutely certain we're all 
                         comfortable and confident with our 
                         firearms.

               Cooper takes out his gun. The other two admire it.

                                     HAWK
                         Nice piece.

                                     COOPER
                         Actually it's regular issue, but 
                         I've made some modifications.
                              (to Truman)
                         How long has Lucy been upset with 
                         Andy?

                                     TRUMAN
                              (thinks he knows how)
                         Body language?

                                     COOPER
                         In this case, it was yelling through 
                         a megaphone.

               Before Truman can talk about him, Andy arrives with the ammo.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Six rounds apiece to start with, 
                         Andy.

                                     ANDY
                              (still with and on 
                              Lucy)
                         Okay.

               Andy glumly distributes bullets to the others, who load up. 
               Cooper slickly arms his own gun with a clip from his pocket.

                                     COOPER
                         Care to tell us about you and Lucy, 
                         Andy?

                                     ANDY
                         Geez, you can tell?

                                     TRUMAN
                         Not too many secrets left around 
                         here.

                                     ANDY
                         She won't speak to me and I don't 
                         know what I did and I don't know why 
                         she's doing what she's doing.

                                     COOPER
                              (chairing the 
                              discussion)
                         Andy, there are a number of old saying 
                         which might pertain to this 
                         discussion. Suffice it to say you're 
                         up against the oldest unsolvable 
                         mystery known to man.

                                     ANDY
                         And I feel like I don't know one 
                         doggone thing.

                                     TRUMAN
                         It's weird. The mystery's what I 
                         like the most... and the less I know 
                         the more interested I get.

               A look between Cooper and Truman. Josie.

                                     ANDY
                         But I just can't figure her out.

                                     COOPER
                         There's no logic at work here, Andy. 
                         Let that one go. In the grand design, 
                         women were drawn from a different 
                         set of blueprints.

                                     HAWK
                         Amen to that.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Hawk, Andy.

                                     COOPER
                         Rapid fire.

               All four men put on headphone ear protectors. Hawk and Andy 
               fire six rapid shots down their separate corridors. Truman 
               hits a button, the targets to return. They take off their 
               protectors.

                                     TRUMAN
                              (to Cooper, back to 
                              women)
                         So where do you stand on the mystery 
                         of it all?

               Cooper inspects Hawk and Andy's targets.

                                     COOPER
                         Harry, the way I look at it a 
                         mystery's just a solution waiting 
                         for the right set of facts. Here, 
                         we're dealing with an area that's 
                         closer to a paradox or an enigma...
                              (examining the targets)
                         Hawk, six of six, two kills, high 
                         marks... Andy...
                              (being delicate)
                         What you need is practice and plenty 
                         of it. One hour, three times a week. 
                         Harry, you'll supply the ordinance?

                                     TRUMAN
                         Whatever it takes.

                                     COOPER
                         Chin up, Andy.

                                     TRUMAN
                              (as he and Cooper 
                              prepare to shoot)
                         Ever been married, Cooper?

                                     COOPER
                         No. I knew someone once who helped 
                         me understand commitment, it's 
                         responsibilities and it's risks

               The four put their ear protectors back on.

                                     COOPER
                              (alone)
                         ...who taught me about the pain of a 
                         broken heart.

               Cooper and Truman fire six shots. Truman hits the button to 
               return the targets.

               Cooper whistles in appreciation, then looks at Truman's 
               target, as Cooper looks at his.

                                     COOPER
                         Harry, one miss, five hits, three 
                         kills. Excellent.

               Truman holds Cooper's. Disappointed.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I don't see a hit here.

                                     COOPER
                         I put four shots through the eyes 
                         and one through each nostril.

               Hawk takes the target out of Truman's hands. Holds it up to 
               the light. Cooper has used his six shots to pierce the 
               nostrils and the eyes. Light comes through from behind. The 
               threesome stares in awe. We hear a beep, then Lucy's voice 
               on the intercom.

                                     LUCY'S VOICE
                         Agent Cooper, I am looking at the 
                         files from Dr. Lydecker's? And for 
                         instance I have here in the "A's" an 
                         Arky, who's a part poodle-part 
                         rotweiler, who lives on Maple and 
                         belongs to Mr. Rumple, then for 
                         example I have an Annette, who is a 
                         otter who lives with a family near 
                         Elk River

                                     COOPER
                         We wanted the names of birds

                                     LUCY
                         I know, but the files are all 
                         organized alphabetically

                                     TRUMAN
                         So go through the bird section--

                                     LUCY
                         No, no, you don't understand; they're 
                         organized alphabetically in the name 
                         of the pet.

               Cooper and Truman look at each other.

                                     COOPER
                         We're gonna need some more coffee.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. JAMES HURLEY'S HOME - DAY

               A housetrailer in the middle of a lonely lot with a couple 
               of aluminum lean-to's off the house. The shades on the windows 
               are drawn. James is working on his Harley under a lean-to.

               James looks up as a car drives down the driveway to the house. 
               COLLEEN HURLEY exits the car, laughing, carrying a small 
               suitcase. She's forty, gave James his good looks. Her's are 
               on the way out. She waves goodbye to the unidentified MIDDLE-
               AGED GENT behind the wheel and the car drives off.

               Colleen sees James, waves, moves towards him.

                                     COLLEEN
                         There he is, the fair-haired boy, 
                         where have you been, my fair-haired 
                         boy?

                                     JAMES
                         I was at school. It's a school day.

                                     COLLEEN
                              (takes out a flask)
                         God bless the public indoctrination 
                         system. Keeps the kids off the 
                         streets... streets are for street-
                         cars and street-sweepers...
                              (takes a drink)

                                     JAMES
                         Where'd you go this time?

                                     COLLEEN
                         Taught a kid in prison once, this 
                         was Ohio, all he wanted out of life 
                         was a job as a San Francisco street 
                         sweeper

                                     JAMES
                         Ma, you been gone four days.

                                     COLLEEN
                         Kiddo, here's how it is; when the 
                         muse cries out, we're helpless to 
                         resist. A poem, she said, four days 
                         worth. Yes, I replied.

                                     JAMES
                              (trying to hide his 
                              feelings)
                         Are you okay?

                                     COLLEEN
                         Myself, I've been better. The poem's 
                         pretty good.

               Takes out a legal pad from the messy suitcase.

                                     COLLEEN
                         I learned early on, write it down, 
                         escape the humdrum hand that life 
                         has dealt you. Play with marked cards.
                              (puts on glasses, 
                              reads)
                         "Poet lariat/Rope, Rope/Bulldogged

                                     JAMES
                         I don't want to hear this right now--

                                     COLLEEN
                         "--Sun goes down, rodeo town/Lariat

                                     JAMES
                         Stop!

               She takes off her glasses, looks at him.

                                     COLLEEN
                         Jimmy, are we being rude?

               James picks up the flask, pours the remainder in the dirt.

                                     COLLEEN
                         Okay, sonny boy, if it makes you 
                         feel better --

                                     JAMES
                              (turns on her)
                         You don't know... anything!

                                     COLLEEN
                         I know girl trouble when I see it. 
                         Some little logtown siren's cut you 
                         up. I recognize the wound patterns.

                                     JAMES
                              (almost laughs)
                         Yeah, you sure can spot it, Ma.

                                     COLLEEN
                         Am I right?

               An awful, bitter pause.

                                     JAMES
                         Her name was Laura.

                                     COLLEEN
                         Lash yourself to the mast, Odysseus.
                              (lifts her drink)
                         Eat the lotus. Forget her. Sail on.
                              (she strokes his face, 
                              compassionate)
                         The danger for you, my darling boy, 
                         is you'll never know whether she's 
                         an angel or a harpie sent from hell 
                         to rend your heart, because believe 
                         me, she'll be one or the other.

               James is close to tears. He can't combat this.

                                     JAMES
                         She was both.

                                     COLLEEN
                         Ah, but that's the secret, Jimmy 
                         boy. They all are.

               James is sickened. He lurches out the door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DOUBLE R DINER - DAY

               The slow hour at the end of the afternoon. Norma cleans up 
               the counter after a customer, a YOUNG TRUCKER who is just 
               leaving. Norma looks at his tip.

                                     NORMA
                         Thanks, Toad, I'll get this into my 
                         retirement fund A.S.A.P.

               Shelly hurries in. She storms by Norma, grabs her apron and 
               heads to the kitchen. Norma follows her, catching up with 
               her at the coffee maker. Good-naturedly.

                                     NORMA
                         Shelly, you're gonna scare the 
                         customers.

                                     SHELLY
                         I've got one man too many in my life. 
                         And I'm married to him. Sound 
                         familiar?

                                     NORMA
                         You think it's time you and Leo have 
                         a talk?

                                     SHELLY
                         Leo doesn't talk. He hits. He was so 
                         great at first, you know? This flashy 
                         guy in his hot car; sure beat sitting 
                         in some stupid classroom... we get 
                         married and I find out what he's 
                         lookin' for is a maid he doesn't 
                         have to pay... I feel so stupid.

               Norma gives her a hug.

                                     NORMA
                         Look at us. Two men apiece and we 
                         don't know what to do with any of 
                         the four of 'em.

                                     SHELLY
                              (feeling comforted)
                         How did Hank's hearing go?

                                     NORMA
                         They said they'd decide this 
                         afternoon.

                                     SHELLY
                         Have you told him you're going to 
                         divorce him for Ed?

                                     NORMA
                         When I saw him I... anyway, he might 
                         not get out this time around. Guess 
                         my plans are a little... up in the 
                         air.

                                     SHELLY
                              (cryptically)
                         Yeah, well, I definitely got plans 
                         for Leo.

               Norma tries to penetrate her look. James enters the diner 
               and goes right to the pay phones.

                                     NORMA
                         Shelly, you know what we're going to 
                         do tomorrow? You and I are going to 
                         have a Day of Beauty. Manicure, 
                         haircut, facial, the works. We are

                         Yeah?

               Donna, in high spirits, is on the phone with James.

                         Hi, James.

               Behind Donna, Doc Hayward comes out of the kitchen holding a 
               recipe, wearing an apron that reads, "Genius at Work." Donna

                         Just a sec--Daddy, please, I'll be 
                         right in, it's James--we're having 
                         the church pot luck dinner here 
                         tonight.

                                     HAYWARD
                         Tell him to get over here, I need 
                         help. SOS, Mayday, Mayday.

               He goes back in the kitchen. She speaks more confidentially.

                                     DONNA
                         Would you like to come?

                                     JAMES
                         I don't think I'd be very good 
                         company.

                                     DONNA
                         James, we need to talk. I've found 
                         some stuff out; Audrey told me some 
                         stuff and Mrs. Palmer saw something--

                                     JAMES
                         What?

               James sees Madeleine Ferguson waiting at the counter talking 
               to Norma.

                                     DONNA
                         Come over later so I can tell you. 
                         Will you come?

                                     JAMES
                         Okay. I'm gonna get something to eat 
                         then I'll be over.

               STAY WITH James. He hangs up. He looks up and sees...

                                                                  INTERCUT:

               JAMES POV - NORMA AND MADELEINE

                                     NORMA
                         I think it's ready, let me go check.

                                     MADELEINE
                         Thanks a lot.

               Practically trembling, James goes up to her. Madeleine looks 
               up, gives him a friendly smile.

                                     MADELEINE
                         Hi.

                                     JAMES
                         Who are you?

                                     MADELEINE
                         I saw you yesterday at the funeral. 
                         My name's Madeleine Ferguson. Laura 
                         was my cousin.

                                     JAMES
                              (still not really 
                              with her)
                         James Hurley.

                                     MADELEINE
                         Laura was a month older than me. 
                         Hadn't seen each other much recently. 
                         I live in Missoula. I'm a receptionist 
                         at a insurance company?
                              (instinctively trying 
                              to cheer him up)
                         Ever been to Missoula?

                                     JAMES
                         I heard it was nice.

                                     MADELEINE
                         From who?
                              (James smiles)
                         So you can smile. Missoula's not so 
                         bad actually.
                              (tries another subject)
                         Did you know Laura well?

                                     JAMES
                         I thought I did.

               Shelly sets Madeleine's order on the counter.

                                     MADELEINE
                         Thanks a lot.
                              (to James)
                         I'm picking up food for my aunt and 
                         uncle. Aunt Sarah can't cook right 
                         now and Uncle Leland's up half the 
                         night listening to old music and 
                         crying and stuff. But if I was cooking 
                         for them they'd be doing even worse. 
                         You think I look like Laura?

                                     JAMES
                         Yes.

                                     MADELEINE
                         We used to come visit Twin Peaks 
                         when I was a kid. It was great. We'd 
                         pretend we were sisters. I wished 
                         I'd known her better. It's so sad.

               James stares at Madeline. She smiles back, uncomplicated.

                                     MADELEINE
                         Well it was nice to meet you, James 
                         Hurley.

               James involuntarily begins to reach across death's void for 
               Laura. Then catches himself.

                                     JAMES
                         Nice to meet you too.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                                     NORMA
                         Thanks for calling, Mr. Mooney.

               She hangs up, pale, slowly runs her hands thru her hair. 
               Shelly sees her, stops.

                                     SHELLY
                         Norma? You okay?

                         Hank got his parole. He's coming 
                         home.

               They look at each other.

               INT. BEN HORNE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Ben is on the phone again with the Icelandics and Jerry, 
               riding an exercise machine.

                                     BEN
                         What's that? No, I'm afraid I don't 
                         know what you get when you cross a 
                         Norwegian and a Swede...
                              (a stiff laugh)
                         That's very good could you put Jerry 
                         back on again?
                              (pause)
                         Jer, who the hell is that joker?... 
                         damn airplane phones, I can hardly 
                         hear you--you're sure he's the 
                         boss?... just make sure they don't 
                         take any eggnog into the pilot... 
                         the jet's gassed up and waiting on 
                         the runway in Seattle, hustle 'em 
                         through customs, make the connection 
                         and save me some of whatever it is 
                         they're having...

               Ben hangs up, spins the globe around. He looks up to discover 
               Audrey standing in his office.

                                     BEN
                         Audrey... I didn't hear you come in.

               Audrey plops down sadly in a chair. Ben sits on the desk, 
               immediately suspicious.

                                     BEN
                         What is it this time?

                                     AUDREY
                         Dad, are you ashamed of me?

                                     BEN
                         Audrey, you're a...
                              (thinks better of 
                              total honestly)
                         You're my daughter.

                                     AUDREY
                         I've been thinking about what we 
                         talked about the other night when 
                         you were so mad.

                                     BEN
                         It's not that I'm ashamed, Audrey, 
                         it's just that I wish I could depend 
                         on you more, especially during a 
                         trying time like this.

                                     AUDREY
                         That's what I want to talk to you 
                         about. Dad, I want to change my life. 
                         I've decided I want to help you with 
                         the family business.
                              (she has his attention)
                         I mean, one of these days you're 
                         going to need someone to take over.  
                         Obviously, it's not going to be 
                         Johnnie.

                              (starts to cry)
                         Daddy, please, I saw a friend that 
                         I've known since childhood cut down 
                         like a flower that had just begun to 
                         bloom. Life can be so short. There 
                         isn't all the time in the world, I 
                         see that now. I want... to change... 
                         my life.

                              skeptical)
                         How, exactly?

                                     AUDREY
                         I don't need to go to college. You 
                         can teach me the business, I'm willing 
                         to start at the absolute bottom.

                                     BEN
                         Well, we've got some guests arriving. 
                         You could go upstairs and make some 
                         beds.

                                     AUDREY
                              (tears again)
                         You still don't believe me--

                                     BEN
                         Alright, alright, alright. Where 
                         would you start?

                                     AUDREY
                         I think I should start at the 
                         Department Store; cosmetics or 
                         something. Part-time, at first, 'til 
                         I graduate.

               Ben comes over to her. Beginning to accept this peace 
               offering.

                                     BEN
                         You're really serious about this.

                                     AUDREY
                         You have to start thinking about the 
                         future, Daddy, just like I am.

                                     BEN

                         Our family's future.

               This strikes home with Ben. He considers. Wipes tears off 
               Audrey's cheek.

                                     AUDREY
                         Please, let me be your daughter again.

               Ben hold his daughter by the shoulders. Stares into her eyes. 
               They embrace across a decade. Ben's quite moved. Audrey's 
               eyes are cold. She's looking at...

                                                                  INTERCUT:

               AUDREY'S POV

               On Ben's desk Audrey sees the framed photograph of LAURA 
               PALMER.

               RESUME SCENE

               Ben's phone rings. Ben breaks the embrace, goes to the phone.

               Audrey smiles sweetly and exits. Ben speaks into the phone.

               He hangs up.

                         Put it with the others.

               He adds it to a small pile in the center of the table. Lucy 
               is heard over the intercom.

                         Agent Cooper, I've got Gordon Cole 
                         on the phone.

               Cooper punches Cole up on the speaker phone.

                                     COOPER
                         Cooper here.

                         found in Laura Palmer's stomach even 
                         as we speak.

               Truman gestures to Hawk, who leaves the room to retrieve the 
               fax.

                         Give Albert my thanks.

               He hangs up, as Hawk re-enters with a fax transmission.

               He hands it to Cooper, Truman and he look at it.

                         Renault.

               Truman and Cooper look at each other. Hawk immediately gets

               A rundown apartment building in the Lotown section of Twin 
               Peaks. Truman's cruiser and Hawk's squad car are parked 
               outside.

               Second floor. Truman, Hawk and Cooper move cautiously down a 
               corridor to the door. Truman is about to knock but Cooper 
               stops him, they listen. Cooper nods, Truman knocks.

               Hearing them, Bobby Briggs climbs out a window and out of 
               the building.

               They hear something from inside. Truman steps back and kicks 
               the door open. He shouts to Hawk as he and Cooper go in.

                         Hawk, outside!

               Hawk runs past them to the window, as Truman and Cooper, 
               guns drawn, check the other rooms. We hear tires SQUEAL from 
               outside.

                                     HAWK
                         Car's going around the side.

               Hawk goes out the window after it.

                         night. Not the night after. The night 
                         after that. Three nights. Green light. 
                         Clear enough?

               Leo nods, lights a match off his thumbnail, lights Ben's 
               cigar.

                                     LEO
                         Excuse me. I got to take Bernard for 
                         a swim.

               Leo hefts Bernard over a shoulder and walks off

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. WOODS CLEARING - NIGHT

               Pitch dark. Then the beam of a flashlight cuts thru the night, 
               moving along the ground.

                                     DONNA'S VOICE
                         But if Mrs. Palmer knows about the 
                         necklace--

                                     JAMES' VOICE
                         How? How could she know?

               Donna and James enter the clearing where they buried the 
               necklace. James lifts the rock.

                                     DONNA
                         She said she saw it, she had a vision 
                         and she said she saw somebody take 
                         it.

                                     JAMES
                              (digging, realizing)
                         Donna, it's not here.

                                     DONNA
                         Then that means someone must have 
                         seen us or followed us here...

                                     JAMES
                         But how did Mrs. Palmer know?

                                     DONNA
                         Laura used to say her mother was 
                         kind of spooky, she used to see stuff, 
                         she'd have dreams. Laura did too.

               An owl hoots. They move closer to one another.

                                     JAMES
                         Maybe we should tell somebody.

                                     DONNA
                         You mean the police?

                                     JAMES
                         If it was the killer, then he knows 
                         that we know

                                     DONNA
                         James, the police didn't love Laura. 
                         Nobody loved her but us.

                                     JAMES
                         I don't want anything to happen to 
                         you. I couldn't stand it, I wouldn't 
                         be able to...

                                     DONNA
                              (giving him strength)
                         Nothing is going to happen to me.

                                     JAMES
                         Just a few days ago we were so happy. 
                         I keep thinking I'm going to see 
                         her, I think I catch a glimpse of 
                         her out of the corner of my eye, 
                         sometimes it's like I really see 
                         her, at school or the Diner...

               James looks away, she takes him by the shoulders.

                                     DONNA
                         James, look at me... we're gonna 
                         find out who killed her. This is 
                         about us. We have to do this for us, 
                         not just for her.
                              (they kiss)
                         I want to be with you...

               They kiss again, more passionately.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Dressed in her nightgown, Josie answers a ringing phone.

                                     JOSIE
                         Hello?...

                                                                  INTERCUT:

               INT. JACQUES RENAULT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Truman is on the phone. Behind him the apartment is being 
               scaled off with yellow tape that reads "Off Limits - Police 
               Investigation."

                                     TRUMAN
                         Josie, it's Harry, listen, I just 
                         can't get away, we've got a break in 
                         the Palmer case--

                                     JOSIE
                         I miss you, I want to talk to you--

                                     TRUMAN
                         I want to talk to you, too, listen, 
                         Josie, were you at the Timber Falls 
                         Motel today?

               PETE MARTELL enters the kitchen through the back door, 
               carrying the mail.

                                     JOSIE
                              (quietly)
                         I have to go. Call me tomorrow.

               She hangs up. Truman looks at the phone, unsettled.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                                     PETE
                         Hey, Josie, blow the whistle, it's 
                         quittin' time.

                                     JOSIE
                         Hello, Pete, how did the shift go?

                                     PETE
                              (pops a beer)
                         Cut some wood, made some lumber. I'm 
                         so tired I could...

                                     JOSIE
                         ...eat a horse? I made you a turkey 
                         sandwich.

               Pete goes through the mail as Josie retrieves the sandwich 
               and unwraps it.

                                     PETE
                         Fantastic, Josie. Is Catherine asleep?

                                     JOSIE
                         Yes.

                                     PETE
                         Then gimme some mayo with that.

               Josie smiles and gets out the mayo. Pete heavily lathers his 
               sandwich.

                                     PETE
                         Josie, how do you feel about fish?

                                     JOSIE
                         To eat?

                         Pete, I don't know the first step 
                         about fishing.

                                     PETE
                         Josie, there's enough fishing in me 
                         for both of us.

               A letter, has captured Josie's interest. She doesn't respond.

                                     PETE
                         So, what do you think?

                                     JOSIE
                         Sure, Pete. Let's give it a run at 
                         the money.

                                     PETE
                         Josie, you're my kind'a gal. I'm 
                         going to hit the hay.

                         Sweet dreams to you, too, Josie.

               Pete exits with his sandwich. Josie opens the letter. She 
               nervously pulls out a piece of paper.

                                                                  INTERCUT:
